screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	i picked out a cart
screv_move_section_grocery	and went down the produce aisle first ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	picking out bananas
screv_move_section_grocery	and strawberries as i went .
unrelev_grocery	lettuce , carrots , and zucchini were next on the list .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i wanted to buy ice cream , but was afraid it would melt ,
screv_move_section_grocery	so i passed the freezer aisle and went straight for the bread .
unrelev_grocery	it 's nice to have good fresh bread for sandwiches , is n't it ?
screv_move_section_grocery	then came the cereal aisle .
unrelev_grocery	oatmeal would make a good change for breakfast .
screv_move_section_grocery	next came the dairy section : yogurt , cheese , butter and eggs were all on the list along with the milk that brought me to the store .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	almost done , i swung back to the freezer aisle to grab that ice cream .
unrelev_grocery	mmm , they had pralines and cream , yummy !
<end_of_story>
screv_go_grocery_grocery	upon the realization i was out of milk and had nothing to make for dinner , i decided to stop at the grocery store .
unrelev_grocery	it was down the street from my apartment , so i hopped into my car and was there within minutes .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i grabbed a basket and headed to the back right corner to get some ground beef ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	then headed to the back left to grab some milk .
screv_move_section_grocery	my journey then continued to the produce department
screv_get_groceries_grocery	where i snagged some broccoli and onions .
unrelev_grocery	with my eyes fixed on the checkout line ,
screv_go_checkout_grocery	i headed in that direction trying to keep my eyes away from the ice cream section .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i failed and took some chocolate ice cream ,
screv_go_checkout_grocery	went to check out .
unrelev_grocery	the line was long , my eyes then wandered to the tabloids
screv_wait_grocery	while the line moved forward .
screv_put_conveyor_grocery	i put my products onto the conveyer belt and smiled at the check out lady .
screv_pay_grocery	after i typed in my phone number for a slight discount , i swung my purse around me to get my wallet and paid .
screv_bring_vehicle_grocery	i took my bags of stuff and walked to my car .
<end_of_story>
screv_make_list_grocery	before i go grocery shopping i make a list .
unrelev_grocery	i actually keep a list going on a magnetic notepad on the fridge and one on my phone whenever i know i am out or low on something .
evoking_grocery	i try to only go once a week unless there is something i really need for a specific meal .
unrelev_grocery	i take my electronic list with me to the store ,
screv_move_section_grocery	but i often still walk up
relnscrev_grocery	and down most aisles just browsing for anything new or that i might want to try .
relnscrev_grocery	i like to keep a rough estimate of how much i am buying by rounding up .
evoking_grocery	so if a can of soup is $ 23 i think $ 23 and keep adding that as i shop if i 'm wanting to stay on a specific budget .
screv_go_checkout_grocery	once i have all my items in my cart i go to the checkout line that seems to have the least amount of people in it .
relnscrev_grocery	i do n't like to jump lines if one line seems to be moving faster .
unrelev_grocery	good to have a little bit of patience .
screv_take_bags_grocery	i try to remember to bring my bags with me
relnscrev_grocery	so that i 'm not always getting plastic bags .
<end_of_story>

screv_go_grocery_grocery	since i went to the store around 23 p.m. , it was n't very crowded .
screv_move_section_grocery	i could relax as i moved my way from produce , dry goods , and then dairy .
relnscrev_grocery	i saw a huge display of easter candy because it is march and the holiday is coming up .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i was so tempted to buy a lot of chocolate but i did n't .

screv_get_groceries_grocery	and frozen foods and put them into my cart next .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	after that , i chose meat and fresh produce as well as things like bread , eggs and chips which need to stay on top of the other food so they wo n't get crushed .
unrelev_grocery	when i had everything i needed ,
screv_go_checkout_grocery	i went to the check out line that seemed the fastest and shortest .
screv_put_conveyor_grocery	then i unloaded my groceries onto the counter
screv_cashier_scan/weight_grocery	so the check out clerk could add the costs .
unrelev_grocery	i was sure to keep my cold foods together

evoking_grocery	last saturday i decided to go grocery shopping .
screv_make_list_grocery	we seemed to be out of a number of things in our house that we needed to cook with , so i sat down a made a list of items .
unrelev_grocery	it seemed to be really large , so i knew i would be gone for a while .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i drove to the grocery store that i like the best ,
relnscrev_grocery	and parked my car .
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	i got a large shopping cart instead of the smaller one , since i knew i had a lot of items to purchase .
screv_move_section_grocery	very slowly , i went up and down each row in the grocery store .
screv_check_list_grocery	i checked my list on each row ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and got the items that i needed .
screv_check_off_grocery	i made sure to cross the item off
screv_get_groceries_grocery	when i put it in my cart , so i knew that i did n't forget anything .
relnscrev_grocery	along the way , i saw some items that were on sale , and decided to purchase those as well , knowing we would use them .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i bought the cold and frozen items last , so they would still be cold by the time i got home .
screv_check_off_grocery	when i had crossed off everything on my list ,
screv_go_checkout_grocery	i went to the front of the store .
relnscrev_grocery	i found an open cash register lane ,
screv_put_conveyor_grocery	and put my items on the conveyor belt .
relnscrev_grocery	the cashier was very friendly and said hello .
screv_cashier_scan/weight_grocery	she began scanning each of my items , and even had to weigh some of them .
screv_pack_groceries_grocery	a nice man was putting my groceries into bags for me ,
relnscrev_grocery	and putting them in my cart
screv_pack_groceries_grocery	as he filled the bags .
unrelev_grocery	when they were done ,
screv_pay_grocery	i paid the cashier the amount due ,
relnscrev_grocery	and she gave me my change , which i put in my purse .
screv_bring_vehicle_grocery	the bagger walked with me out to my car and helped me put the groceries in the trunk of my car .
relnscrev_grocery	i said thank you to him ,
screv_leave_grocery	and then drove home .
screv_leave_grocery	when i got there , it took a while to bring all of the bags inside , but my children helped me .
relnscrev_grocery	we all had fun putting the groceries away , and were glad the shelves were filled with what we needed again .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_grocery	being that we needed food in the house ,
relnscrev_grocery	i went through the cupboards and refrigerator to see what was there
screv_make_list_grocery	and made a list of what we needed .
unrelev_grocery	we were almost out of food so it was a long list .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	then i drove to the grocery store .
screv_move_section_grocery	first i went to the meat isle
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and picked out some juicy steaks and a chicken .
screv_move_section_grocery	then i went the the vegetable isle
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and picked out some fresh asparagus , broccoli , and salad fixings .
screv_move_section_grocery	next i went to the canned goods
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and picked out some cans to keep in the house .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i picked out some chili , soups and stews .
unrelev_grocery	these are always good to have in the house for a quick meal .
screv_move_section_grocery	then i went to the dairy section
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and picked out some sour cream and milk .
screv_go_checkout_grocery	then i pushed the cart to the payment isles
screv_pay_grocery	and paid for the groceries .
<end_of_story>
evoking_grocery	i needed to do my weekly grocery shopping .
relnscrev_grocery	i prepared by first looking through my cupboards and the refrigerator and freezer to see what i already had and what i needed .
screv_make_list_grocery	then i made a list by category of everything i needed for the upcoming week .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i drove to shopper 's food warehouse ,
relnscrev_grocery	parked the car ,
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	found a cart near the front door
screv_enter_grocery	and went in to begin my shopping .
unrelev_grocery	i started in the produce section
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and picked out everything i needed in the way of fruits and vegetables .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	then i shopped for meats , cheeses , canned goods , milk , eggs , juice , bread , cereal , paper products , and frozen items .
screv_go_checkout_grocery	i went through the check-out line with my purchases
screv_pay_grocery	and paid with a credit card .
screv_pack_groceries_grocery	the cashier bagged all my items
relnscrev_grocery	and put them back in the cart .
screv_bring_vehicle_grocery	i rolled the cart close to my car and unloaded the bags into the trunk of my car ,
relnscrev_grocery	then went home and put everything away .
<end_of_story>
screv_get_groceries_grocery	every sunday i check our pantry , fridge and freezer to see what i need to buy from the grocery store .
relnscrev_grocery	i also have to check the pet supplies as i have dogs and cats that eat a lot !
unrelev_grocery	i carry a piece of paper with me
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and write down what i need to get .
unrelev_grocery	i also have an idea of what meals i intend to cook during the week and what ingredients i will need to make those meals ,
screv_make_list_grocery	so i add them to the list .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i know which store or stores i am going to visit and i know the layout of the store so i try
relnscrev_grocery	and make my list in the same order that the items will be found once i get there .
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	i pick up a cart on the way into the store
screv_move_section_grocery	and head for the first aisle that i need to visit .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	most supermarkets have their frozen foods at one end so i start at the other end as it is best to buy frozen items last so they do n't start to melt while i 'm walking round the store .
unrelev_grocery	i work my way through my shopping list ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	selecting items off the shelf and placing them into my cart , trying not to squash lighter things under heavy things
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and also making sure i buy items that have a use by date that is later than the day i intend to use them .
relnscrev_grocery	i am also keeping an approximate idea of how much everything costs so i have some idea of my total bill .
screv_wait_grocery	when i am done with everything i wait at a checkout .
unrelev_grocery	there is nearly always someone in front of me but the checkout people work fast
screv_wait_grocery	and i never wait for long .
screv_put_conveyor_grocery	i place all my items on the conveyor belt
screv_cashier_scan/weight_grocery	and the person on the checkout counter scans them for prices .
relnscrev_grocery	the prices all add up on a screen in front of me so i can see how much i am spending .
screv_pack_groceries_grocery	while the checkout person scans my items another shop assistant packs all my items carefully into bags
relnscrev_grocery	and places them back in my cart .
relnscrev_grocery	when i am finished i am always asked if i need any help taking my bags to the car but i always refuse as i think other people in the store need help more than i do .
screv_leave_grocery	i load the car and drive home
relnscrev_grocery	and then have to put everything into the pantry , freezer or refrigerator .
evoking_grocery	that is my least favorite part of grocery shopping !
<end_of_story>
evoking_grocery	i love going grocery shopping !
unrelev_grocery	i have a very specific way that i approach it and i do the same thing each week .
unrelev_grocery	on tuesdays , the grocery ads come out for the week .
relnscrev_grocery	i look through them and make a list of what is on sale .
relnscrev_grocery	i meal plan around those things .
screv_make_list_grocery	once i have a list of what i will be cooking ,
screv_make_list_grocery	i write those ingredients down along with all of the other things i want or need .
relnscrev_grocery	i separate them by department .
relnscrev_grocery	i put all of the dairy items together , then the meat items , followed by the produce , and so on .
unrelev_grocery	this makes it more efficient
screv_move_section_grocery	when i am pushing a cart through the store .
unrelev_grocery	once i 'm at the store ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i select my items quickly .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i usually buy the same brands and often the same items each week , so i know where everything is .
unrelev_grocery	when i 'm ready ,
screv_go_checkout_grocery	i go to the checkout
screv_put_conveyor_grocery	and put it all on the belt
screv_pay_grocery	so i can pay for it .
relnscrev_grocery	i love grocery shopping but i hate to put it all away
screv_leave_grocery	when i get home !
<end_of_story>

evoking_grocery	i realized that i did n't have everything i needed and had to go the grocery store for it .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i drove to the store
screv_enter_grocery	and got out and walked inside .
screv_make_list_grocery	after making a short list in my head ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i wandered the aisles and grabbed the chicken , fresh vegetables and all of the necessary ingredients for the meal , as it has a lot of them .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	after grabbing everything i needed i then walked to the checkout counter .

screv_enter_grocery	and when i got in the first thing i did was check the clearance section and sales .
screv_move_section_grocery	after that i walked the aisle , making sure to pick up everything that i needed .
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	i avoided using a shopping cart to be sure that i would not buy more than i could carry .
screv_go_checkout_grocery	after picking up all the items i went to the checkout
screv_pay_grocery	where i paid for my purchases in cash .
screv_pack_groceries_grocery	after that i put the items in my backpack
screv_leave_grocery	and walked out of the store and back to my house .

relnscrev_grocery	but i got 23 percent off with my discount card .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_grocery	my fridge was completely empty , so i knew i had to go get some groceries .

relnscrev_grocery	and parked my car .
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	i grabbed a shopping cart from the front of the store
screv_enter_grocery	and walked through the big sliding doors .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	it 's amazing how many kinds of food there are to buy there .
screv_make_list_grocery	luckily , i had made a shopping list

evoking_grocery	my favorite place to shop is a huge membership store , for its good prices .
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	i pick up a shopping cart just outside the store .

<end_of_story>
screv_go_grocery_grocery	yesterday , i went to the grocery store to buy food .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i went to my locally-owned supermarket , bet-r , because i like to support small businesses .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i go in the early afternoons when i can to avoid the rush of people going after school or work -- that way i do n't have to wait in long lines at checkout .
screv_make_list_grocery	i brought my shopping list with me : eggs , milk , bread , pasta , and other staples .
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	i picked up a handbasket as my list was not large and began to peruse the aisles .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i picked up everything on my list , except one thing .
relnscrev_grocery	they were out of my favorite variety of pasta sauce ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	so i bought a new kind to try instead .

relnscrev_grocery	so both kids can sit inside .

screv_get_groceries_grocery	i always grab other things as i see them and realize i need them .
unrelev_grocery	it can be a good thing , or a bad thing .
screv_make_list_grocery	we usually end up with quite a bit more than i intended ,

screv_wait_grocery	so , we get into the check out line
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and of course i have to tell my oldest child we ca n't get every candy he sees in the aisle
screv_wait_grocery	while we are waiting .

evoking_grocery	going grocery shopping is a routine task for most people .
relnscrev_grocery	as most groceries nearby now require the use of reusable tote bags rather than offering paper or plastic bags , the trip usually begins at home with remembering to take along a tote or two .
screv_move_section_grocery	i begin my trip by starting down the aisle to either the far right or left and continuing from there .
relnscrev_grocery	if the store offers an ad at the door i will usually pick one up and decide if there are any deals i wish to take advantage of .
screv_pay_grocery	keeping an eye on my spending is importnat ,
screv_pay_grocery	as grocery expenses can add up quickly .
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	if i am doing major shopping i will use a cart , but if i 'm just stopping for a few items ,
relnscrev_grocery	a hand basket will suffice .
screv_pay_grocery	when paying for my items i do my best to find the shortest line with the fastest checker
screv_wait_grocery	so i can be in and out as quickly as possible .

relnscrev_grocery	i usually shop at a discount store that has really good deals on certain items .
relnscrev_grocery	towards the end of the month , they hold a wine sale where all bottles are twenty percent off .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i usually purchase my wine for the month during that time .
relnscrev_grocery	wine was on my list for today as well .
relnscrev_grocery	my pantry had a lot of dry goods , so i had little intention of purchasing products in that category .
relnscrev_grocery	my deep freezer was running low , so one of the things i kept an eye out for was meat that was on sale .
relnscrev_grocery	i was able to find hams at severely discounted price !
screv_get_groceries_grocery	after grabbing four bottles of wine with the rest of my groceries ,
screv_go_checkout_grocery	i went to the cashier ,
screv_pay_grocery	checked out ,
relnscrev_grocery	and drove home to put all the food away .
<end_of_story>
screv_go_grocery_grocery	we began by driving past the overloaded parking lot dreading finding a parking spot .
evoking_grocery	luckily we know of a spot on the side of the grocery store that is almost always vacant .
relnscrev_grocery	my girlfriend and i park in our normal spot
screv_enter_grocery	and walk inside .
relnscrev_grocery	the store is booming with people and all the lines are full .
screv_enter_grocery	we are the type of people who do not like a lot of people so we wanted to get in and out as fast as we could .
relnscrev_grocery	quickly we get all the groceries marked down on the list
screv_go_checkout_grocery	and we head to the checkout line .
unrelev_grocery	we found a shorter line that was for a lesser amount of groceries .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	luckily we had 23 items less than the maximum for the line ,
screv_pay_grocery	so we hopped in and quickly got checked out and on our way .
screv_bring_vehicle_grocery	i carried the groceries out to the car rather than having the employees do it because there are much less able people who need there help more than i do .
screv_leave_grocery	finally we headed home and used our groceries to cook dinner .
<end_of_story>
evoking_grocery	on friday , i decided to go grocery shopping .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	my mother made a list of all the items we needed and i went to go buy them .
unrelev_grocery	while i was at the grocery store ,
screv_check_list_grocery	i looked for everything on the list .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	some of them were hard to find ,
relnscrev_grocery	so i had to ask a worker
screv_get_groceries_grocery	where to find them .
screv_move_section_grocery	they were very helpful and pointed where to go .
unrelev_grocery	some of the items were not available
relnscrev_grocery	so i had to get a raincheck .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	after i got all the available items ,
screv_wait_grocery	i had to stand on line at the checkout .
unrelev_grocery	the line was very long
relnscrev_grocery	and there were no other checkout lines open .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	it was frustrating because i did not have that much items to buy .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	meanwhile , there were at least four people ahead of me with a lot of items to buy .
unrelev_grocery	i am very impatient .
relnscrev_grocery	fortunately , one person ahead of me was kind enough to let me skip him .
unrelev_grocery	i was very appreciative .
screv_leave_grocery	finally , i left the grocery store with my items .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_grocery	last weekend , i got into my car to head to the grocery store .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	the store i normally go grocery shop at is safeway ,
screv_go_grocery_grocery	with the exception of the few times i go to savemart .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	but for this time , i headed to safeway .
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	i grabbed a shopping cart
screv_move_section_grocery	and immediately went to the left of the store like i normally do .
relnscrev_grocery	i grabbed the bread items i needed along with any breakfast pastries i enjoy buying .
screv_move_section_grocery	like normal , i skip the first four aisles due to them being for personal care and pet care .
relnscrev_grocery	i buy my personal items elsewhere -lrb- such as shampoo , etc. -rrb- .
screv_move_section_grocery	i then went down the beverage aisle
screv_get_groceries_grocery	where i picked up several gatorades and bottled waters .
screv_move_section_grocery	i then continue going up each aisle after the beverage one ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	where i would pick up my frozen foods , canned foods , snacks -lrb- such as chips and cookies -rrb- , and any other lunch items -lrb- frozen or non-frozen -rrb- .
screv_move_section_grocery	i then ended with the fruits and vegetables ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	where i picked up a bunch of bananas and about four apples .
screv_go_checkout_grocery	i took my cart to the lone open register
screv_wait_grocery	after waiting for about five minutes .
screv_pay_grocery	after purchasing my items ,
screv_leave_grocery	i went out to my car
screv_bring_vehicle_grocery	and packed my groceries into the trunk .
<end_of_story>
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i go grocery shopping every week to get food
relnscrev_grocery	and any other items that my husband and i need for the week .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i wait to go shopping usually
screv_make_list_grocery	until thursday or friday so that i can use the weekly ads to make my list .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i shop for items on sale , so i like to be very prepared .
relnscrev_grocery	i also use the store 's apps on my phone to track what deals they are offering for me this week .
screv_make_list_grocery	i plan out my list based on the ads and the apps ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and write each store 's name above the items i want to buy there .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	on the day i decide to go , i drive to the first store which is whichever one i am getting less more cold things at .
relnscrev_grocery	this way , they will stay colder together than
screv_get_groceries_grocery	if i buy one cold thing
relnscrev_grocery	and it 's sitting by itself in the heat of the car
screv_get_groceries_grocery	while i shop at the next store .
relnscrev_grocery	i park my car as close as i can to the entrance
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	and grab a cart .
screv_check_list_grocery	i begin by opening my list and deciding which part of the store i am going to start in ,
screv_move_section_grocery	and then work my way to the other end
relnscrev_grocery	as i get the items that i need .
screv_move_section_grocery	i try to go quickly so it does n't take much time .
screv_move_section_grocery	when i 'm ready , i go to the front of the store and get into a line with a number that is lit up .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	if i have less than 23 or 23 items ,
screv_move_section_grocery	i will sometimes go to the express lane .
screv_wait_grocery	i wait for it to be my turn and unload the groceries onto the conveyor belt .
screv_cashier_scan/weight_grocery	after the cashier rings up my items ,
screv_pay_grocery	i will pay with either cash or my credit card .
screv_bring_vehicle_grocery	the items get bagged up and placed into my cart for me .
screv_bring_vehicle_grocery	i thank the cashier and take the cart to
screv_bring_vehicle_grocery	where my car is parked and put the groceries inside it .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i then go to the next store
relnscrev_grocery	and get any items i need there .
relnscrev_grocery	i drive home and bring all the groceries inside my house , and then put them all away wherever they go .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_grocery	i needed to go on my weekly grocery shopping trip last weekend .
screv_make_list_grocery	so , i went to my fridge and started to make a list of the cold items that i would need .
relnscrev_grocery	then , i checked out my cabinet to be sure that i picked up a few canned goods that i needed as well .
relnscrev_grocery	i checked through my coupons and took the ones that i needed .
relnscrev_grocery	i grabbed my wallet , helmet , sunglasses , and my insulated backpack and went outside to get on my bike .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	after going through traffic , i arrived at the store
relnscrev_grocery	and parked my bike .
screv_enter_grocery	i went into the store
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	and grabbed one of the smaller carts ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	since i would not need to get too many things this trip .
relnscrev_grocery	i put my backpack
screv_enter_grocery	and helmet in the cart and went inside .
relnscrev_grocery	i just needed some cream , milk , eggs , sausage , cheese , and some veggies .
screv_move_section_grocery	i dodged around other shoppers and headed towards the veggies .
relnscrev_grocery	salad blends were on sale ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	so i picked some up .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i also grabbed a nice head of broccoli as well .
screv_move_section_grocery	then i went to the refrigerated section
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and selected my meats and things , being sure to check for discounted meats .
screv_pay_grocery	my list was all checked off so i went to the self-checkout to pay .

screv_pay_grocery	and paid .
screv_pack_groceries_grocery	i loaded my items into my backpack and put both it

unrelev_grocery	when i was a young boy ,
screv_go_grocery_grocery	my mother would always take me grocery shopping with her .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	to me , i thought i was just playing around with the grocery items that they bought and handed to me to put in the shopping cart .
relnscrev_grocery	to this day she always tells me how helpful i was to organize the cans , frozen items , snacks and produce in a different spot in the shopping cart .
unrelev_grocery	she also mentioned that it always kept me occupied and i never begged for any chips or sugary enriched items .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	so my mother loved to take me grocery shopping .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i think that since she always took me grocery shopping with her , that is why i love to go grocery shopping now that i am an adult .
screv_move_section_grocery	i walk around the store with a shopping list
screv_check_off_grocery	and mark off the items
screv_move_section_grocery	as i walk down the aisles .
screv_move_section_grocery	i then go to the cashier
screv_put_conveyor_grocery	and quickly put my items up on the side
screv_pay_grocery	and they are all rung up and i swipe the credit card
relnscrev_grocery	and take my groceries home .
<end_of_story>
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i went grocery shopping late last night .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i like going at night
relnscrev_grocery	because it 's not so crowded .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	first i made a list of the things i needed then headed to the store .
relnscrev_grocery	another nice thing about shopping late is that you get to park right near the door , which makes things easier
screv_leave_grocery	when you come out .
screv_enter_grocery	once i got inside ,
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	i grabbed a shopping cart
screv_check_list_grocery	and took out my list .
screv_move_section_grocery	there was nothing out of the ordinary on the list , so i started heading down the aisles just like i always do .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i always keep track of the cost of everything i pick out on my tablet
screv_move_section_grocery	as i go so that i know if i can afford anything extra .
relnscrev_grocery	the time a couple thing i needed were on sale , so i did have some extra money .
screv_move_section_grocery	i decided that i needed some cookies and headed over the the cookie aisle .
unrelev_grocery	i looked at the oreos for a little while ,
relnscrev_grocery	then checked the other cookies .
unrelev_grocery	i decided on chocolate chip cookies this time ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	so i put the on top of the other things in my cart
screv_go_checkout_grocery	and went to the checkout lane .
screv_pack_groceries_grocery	i paid and got everything bagged ,
screv_bring_vehicle_grocery	then headed out to my car .

screv_go_grocery_grocery	before i had left ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i made a list of most of the things that i needed to buy for the week .
relnscrev_grocery	i looked at the sales advertisement that had come in the mail and made a note of a few things that were on sale .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i needed to buy milk , bread , eggs , coffee , and some items to make lunches for me to take to work for the week .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	when i got to the store ,
screv_move_section_grocery	i first went to the deli
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and picked out some lunch meat .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i got some turkey , ham , and salami .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i then picked up some cheddar cheese .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	near the deli , i grabbed some bread , which happened to be on sale .
relnscrev_grocery	a few isles over , i found some decent coffee that was not on sale .
relnscrev_grocery	my shopping was almost complete
screv_get_groceries_grocery	after i picked up a half gallon of milk and a dozen eggs .
relnscrev_grocery	i saw that the yogurt was on sale ,

<end_of_story>
evoking_grocery	most people grocery shop once a week .
unrelev_grocery	in my house that really does n't work for us ;
unrelev_grocery	my wife and i work shifts that could change and we never know when our son will or wo n't be home
screv_go_grocery_grocery	so when i shop for groceries it 's only looking one or two days ahead .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	there 's two places that i usually go for my groceries ;
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i either shop at wegmans , which is a grocery store near where i work , or walmart , of which there are two near me , about equal distances from where i work .
unrelev_grocery	i 'll talk to my wife before i leave work , we 'll decide on dinner
screv_go_grocery_grocery	and then i 'll go to whichever store i decide on -lrb- for example , if we 're having fresh meat we prefer to get it at wegmans , but if we 're making a casserole or something similar i can get it at wegmans -rrb- .
unrelev_grocery	i 'll leave work ,
screv_go_grocery_grocery	head to whichever store i 've chosen and , without spending alot of time wandering ,
relnscrev_grocery	get the exact items i need ,
screv_leave_grocery	pay for them and leave .
evoking_grocery	to me , grocery shopping is more of a necessity than something i enjoy so i want it done quickly .
<end_of_story>
evoking_grocery	with a family of five it seemed like all we ever did was go to the supermarket .
unrelev_grocery	walmart and i built a strong personal relationship .
unrelev_grocery	not only did they have household items and clothes that i loved , they had food .
relnscrev_grocery	every week i spend an hour online printing and sorting my coupons .
relnscrev_grocery	it is always to good to grab extra deals even if it is just cents off .
screv_make_list_grocery	after compiling my coupons i make my shopping list
relnscrev_grocery	and break it down to aisles .
unrelev_grocery	it 's so amazing that i have been to walmart so many times that i remember their aisles .
screv_move_section_grocery	when i arrive in the food section i start with the middle aisles first
screv_move_section_grocery	and then i work my way around ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	getting milk last .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	sometimes i have to buy so many things that i leave with two or three carts .
evoking_grocery	grocery shopping is beyond a tedious task that i hate to love .
<end_of_story>
screv_make_list_grocery	before going shopping i make a shopping list and look through my fridge and cupboards to make sure i buy everything i need .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i then get into my car and drive to the store .
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	upon entering the store i grab a shopping cart
screv_move_section_grocery	and walk to the fresh fruits and vegetables .
screv_move_section_grocery	after getting all of my fresh items i go to the butcher stand
screv_get_groceries_grocery	and get some chicken and beef .
screv_move_section_grocery	i sometimes make a stop to et lunch meat and bread so i can make sandwiches for lunch .
screv_move_section_grocery	next i go to the dairy section
screv_get_groceries_grocery	where i buy cheese , milk and eggs .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	after that i go buy some snacks and canned items .
screv_move_section_grocery	to end my trip i go to the frozen foods section because i want to make sure my frozen items stay cold until i am home .
screv_cashier_scan/weight_grocery	i get in line and wait to be cashed out .
screv_pay_grocery	i almost always pay with my credit card so i do n't have to worry about money .
screv_leave_grocery	i then leave the store , head home and unload all my groceries .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_grocery	last night i realized i did not have anything for dinner .
unrelev_grocery	to solve this conundrum i first thought about ordering out food .
unrelev_grocery	this , i realized , was too expensive as i am a broke college graduate just trying to get by .
unrelev_grocery	i settled on an alternative ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	going to the grocery store to purchase food .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	i walked down the street from my apartment to the whole foods in the brisk spring air .
unrelev_grocery	i was on a mission ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	purchase delicious food .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	when i reached the whole foods , the distinct smell of smug filled my nostrils .
screv_move_section_grocery	organic , natural , non deoderized humans paced to and fro within the confines of the kale infused shelving units .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i quickly scuttled to the small frozen foods section to purchase some ` healthy ' junk food .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	i selected chicken tenders and a small frozen pizza .
screv_move_section_grocery	skirting the weed smoking hippies throughout the store i returned to the front .
screv_leave_grocery	i quickly made my purchase and sprinted back towards home to concoct my wonderfully delicious tendies and pizza .

evoking_grocery	grocery shopping can be a stressful event ,
screv_go_grocery_grocery	but if you come prepared then you can usually leave without a headache .
relnscrev_grocery	before we head over to the store we need to make a list of all the items that we need .
screv_enter_grocery	once you arrive at the store if you have a short list make sure to grab a basket .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	if you are purchasing a wider variety of items
screv_take_shop_cart_grocery	then grab a shopping cart .
unclear_grocery	i would recommend starting on the outside perimeter of the store ,
screv_get_groceries_grocery	hitting up your dairy , meats , and vegetables .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	while you are working your way clockwise or counter-clockwise you can frequent the aisles in the middle to pickup the remainder of items .
relnscrev_grocery	spending a lot of time in the aisles can become frustrating since people are more likely to be in your way .
screv_get_groceries_grocery	after you select all the items to purchase ,
screv_go_checkout_grocery	find the shortest checkout line .
screv_put_conveyor_grocery	once you are close enough start piling your groceries on the belt ,
screv_pay_grocery	and take out your form of payment .
screv_pay_grocery	once paid ,
screv_pack_groceries_grocery	the store will generally bag your groceries for you .
screv_bring_vehicle_grocery	now you just need to load your car ,
screv_leave_grocery	drive home ,
relnscrev_grocery	and unload all of your bounty !
<end_of_story>

screv_enter_grocery	and we enter the store .
relnscrev_grocery	we go through the store and using my list grab what i need .
screv_go_grocery_grocery	since i usually go two or more times a week ,
