relnscrev_flight	'' before you board the plane you should consider picking up a bottle of water and a snack in case they do n't have anything you 'd like to drink or eat on the flight .
relnscrev_flight	you should also stop at the restroom so , hopefully , you wo n't have to go to the bathroom during the flight .
relnscrev_flight	if you have an assigned seat for your flight do n't rush to get on because it 'll just mean sitting there for a longer period of time .
screv_board_plane_flight	once you are ready to board just be patient with everyone else who is flying and with the flight attendants .
screv_stow_away_luggage_flight	once you have found your seat store any large items overhead
relnscrev_flight	and keep whatever you might want during the flight in the seat-back .
relnscrev_flight	i suggest putting your electronic devices there , headphones , books etc. .
relnscrev_flight	i also like to make sure to have gum , my snack and my water readily available .
relnscrev_flight	if you have a smaller item you can put that underneath the seat in front of you .
screv_other_flight_flight	it is a good idea to chew gum at least at the start of the flight so you avoid having your ears pop .
unrelev_flight	try to stay hydrated during your flight ,
relnscrev_flight	and keep your seat-belt on whenever you are sitting down .

evoking_flight	i was excited to go home for the holidays last december , but i was less excited about having to take an airplane !
evoking_flight	i normally would drive , but my mother persuaded me to take a plane because she was afraid i would have to drive through snow .
screv_pack_luggage_flight	i filled a single suitcase with as many necessities i could fit , because i did not want to have to deal with putting multiple suitcases through the luggage handler .
screv_get_airport_flight	i arrived at the airport
screv_check_in_flight	and waited in line to check in .
screv_go_security_checks_flight	i let the tsa search me for any contraband that would not be allowed on the plane ,
screv_wait_boarding_flight	and then waited to be allowed to board .

screv_take_seat_flight	i walked over to my seat
screv_stow_away_luggage_flight	and shoved my suitcase into the overhead compartment .
relnscrev_flight	luckily it fit , so i would be able to keep it with me .
relnscrev_flight	i snuggled into my seat and tried to ignore the butterflies in my stomach .
relnscrev_flight	flying always makes me nervous .
relnscrev_flight	the person seated directly next to me was a middle aged woman flying alone .
unrelev_flight	she gave me a sympathetic smile and asked me if i was as nervous as she was .
unrelev_flight	i said yes , and i think we both felt better that at least we would be good seatmates .
unrelev_flight	the plane ride was uneventful ;

screv_go_security_checks_flight	we took off our shoes , husband took off his belt , and we placed our luggage on the x-ray belt .

unrelev_flight	everything went without a hitch
relnscrev_flight	and we grabbed our belongings and put our shoes back on .

relnscrev_flight	after i parked my car in the parking lot ,
screv_go_check_in_flight	i found the right ticket counter for my airline
screv_check_in_flight	and then turned in my suitcase
relnscrev_flight	so it could travel in the cargo of the plane .
screv_find_terminal_flight	then i went to a place called a gate which is really just an indoor place to wait for my plane to arrive .
screv_board_plane_flight	it has a big window where i watched the planes and waited for my turn to get on one .
screv_other_flight_flight	once my plane arrived ,
relnscrev_flight	a nice flight attendant showed me to my seat
screv_wait_flight	and i sat down to wait .
unrelev_flight	my seat was comfortable , but small , and there were people sitting on each side of me .
relnscrev_flight	once everyone settled in ,
screv_take_off_flight	the plane started and then drove down the runway to wait its turn to take off .
screv_take_off_flight	when we took off , it rose into the air
relnscrev_flight	and then leveled off to what the pilot called cruising speed .
screv_other_flight_flight	then the flight attendants brought around food and drinks .
screv_spend_time_flight_flight	the plane was a little noisy , but it was fun to watch the people and the food was pretty good .
screv_spend_time_flight_flight	the plane ride was short and we had barely finished our food
screv_listen_crew_flight	and drinks before the pilot said it was time to land in the next town .
relnscrev_flight	the flight attendants came back around to pick up our trash
screv_landing_flight	and then we had to buckle our seat belts again for the plane to land .

relnscrev_flight	i was flying on a weekday ,
relnscrev_flight	so the line was very long with people who were flying for work , even though it was still early in the morning .

relnscrev_flight	it was very loud with the noise of the engine .
screv_take_off_flight	a few minutes after we took off ,
screv_listen_crew_flight	the pilot came on the intercom
screv_leave_airport_flight	and gave us some details about the weather and our flight time .
screv_other_flight_flight	then , the flight attendants walked past in the aisles with their cart , and offered me a drink .

relnscrev_flight	all of sudden we were speeding very fast down the runway ,
screv_take_off_flight	and then lifted into the air .
relnscrev_flight	it 's surprising such a big plane can fly so easily .

unrelev_flight	true to my phobia i was in near tears and gripping the seats but once the flight was off the ground i was happy .
screv_spend_time_flight_flight	the flight came with a tv in the back of the set in front of you and there was so many choices of what to watch .
unrelev_flight	i love documentaries and there were numerous ones .
unrelev_flight	i almost hated when the flight was over .
relnscrev_flight	the only part that i found difficult was that , i did not have an end seat and so i hesitated to use the bathroom and did n't do so until i was in extreme discomfort because i did n't want to bother the person on the end seat .
relnscrev_flight	so , next time i decide to travel the only change i would make is to select an end seat that way bathroom use is not an issue .

relnscrev_flight	when we flew with my dad ,
screv_take_seat_flight	my stepmother sat in the front seat and all three of us kids sat in the back seat .
unrelev_flight	we were small ,
relnscrev_flight	so we all fit .
unrelev_flight	there was n't much room for luggage ,
relnscrev_flight	but my dad would load the luggage behind the back seat .
screv_take_off_preparations_flight	then he would do the preflight checks .
unrelev_flight	some of these were outside the plane , but most of them were done from the inside .
screv_take_off_flight	he would radio the tower and ask for permission to take off .
unrelev_flight	this was always very exciting .
screv_take_off_flight	the takeoff was a little scary because in a plane that small you could really feel the wind
screv_take_off_flight	and the forces of the take off .
unrelev_flight	the flight itself was fairly boring because you could n't really see anything from the back .
unrelev_flight	sadly , i had bad motion sickness ,
relnscrev_flight	and my main memory of the landings is throwing up down the back of my dad 's neck .

screv_take_off_preparations_flight	and told everybody we were ready to depart ,
screv_take_off_preparations_flight	i carefully increased the speed of the plane
relnscrev_flight	as it bolted down the runway .
relnscrev_flight	as the plane reached maximum speed on the driveway ,
screv_take_off_flight	i slowly pulled on the lever to lift the plane off the ground slowly .
unrelev_flight	the plane eventually came completely off the runway
relnscrev_flight	and was in flight .
screv_other_flight_flight	i pulled the lever to lift the wheels into the plane .
relnscrev_flight	i manuveured the plane 's direction with the pilot wheel to aim it at the direction i wanted to go .
screv_other_flight_flight	as soon as the plane was at a maximum flying height i put the autopilot on and let the plane 's computer fly it automatically .
relnscrev_flight	i sat back and kept watched over the data on the plane 's dashboard the rest of the flight until we got to where we were going .

relnscrev_flight	my cousin wanted me to visit him in florida over the summer and i needed to make a plan and book a flight to get there .
relnscrev_flight	after searching on the internet for a great price , i found one and booked it .
evoking_flight	the day of the flight i was a bit nervous as it had been a long time since i had flown on an airplane .
screv_board_plane_flight	i boarded along with the other passengers and realized that i had a great window seat in a good location
relnscrev_flight	so i was n't crowded in .
screv_take_off_flight	after a very smooth take off ,
screv_spend_time_flight_flight	the flight attendants brought me something to drink and a snack .
unrelev_flight	it was a very smooth flight and about 23 hours later ,
relnscrev_flight	i ended up at my destination .

screv_other_flight_flight	after we parked at our terminal ,

unrelev_flight	i was on my way to disney world .
unrelev_flight	i was very nervous and was n't sure what to expect !
screv_take_seat_flight	i sat down next to my mom and she explained what would happen .
screv_listen_crew_flight	she told me the flight attendant would talk to us about safety but that air travel was very safe and i should worry .
screv_take_off_flight	then she told me that we were getting ready to take off !
unrelev_flight	she told me we 'd go up in the air
screv_other_flight_flight	and then the wheels would retract .
unrelev_flight	i was relieved to know what that sound was
