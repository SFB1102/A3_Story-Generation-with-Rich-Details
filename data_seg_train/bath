evoking_bath	'' after playing football with my friends , i was all sweaty and dirty , so i decide i should take a bath .
unrelev_bath	first i made sure there were clean towels available
screv_wash_bath	and enough soap and shampoo to thoroughly clean my skin and hair .
screv_close_drain_bath	i put the plug in the bottom of the bath tub
screv_turn_water_on_bath	and turned on the water , being careful to adjust the water to a nice warm , but no too hot , temperature .
screv_check_temp_bath	i used my finger to determine just the right temperature .
relnscrev_bath	after removing my clothes and placing them in the hamper ,
screv_sink_water_bath	i carefully stepped into the tub , being sure to steady myself as i entered .
screv_sink_water_bath	i gingerly lowered myself into the nice warm water and immediately began to relax .
relnscrev_bath	after a few minutes of rest and relaxation , i got out the soap
screv_wash_bath	and thoroughly washed my whole body , making sure to get all of the dirt and grass stains off that i had accumulated from playing football .
screv_wash_bath	next i washed my hair with shampoo
relnscrev_bath	and laid back into the water to really rinse it out well .
screv_get_out_bath_bath	i carefully exited the bath tub , making sure to step onto the bath mat so i would n't slip on the smooth floor tiles ,
screv_dry_bath	and got a towel and dried myself off .
unrelev_bath	now my bath was complete and i felt so nice and clean ! what a great feeling !
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bath	yesterday was a long and stressful day .
unrelev_bath	from start to finish , it felt like nothing could possibly go right .
screv_wash_bath	on days like those , i really love a nice bubble bath to relax and wash off the stress , so that is what i did .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i gathered up a towel , body wash , shampoo , conditioner ,
screv_enter_bathroom_bath	bubble bath and a few candles and walked into my bathroom to take a nice , long bath .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i lit the cinnamon-scented candles ,
screv_turn_water_on_bath	turned on the water to make sure it would be warm before i stepped in ,
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	then i dropped a little bit of the bubble bath in the water to create a gentle lather .
screv_sink_water_bath	i sank into the bubbles and took a deep breath .
screv_relax_bath	it felt amazing to get to relax after such a rough day .
unrelev_bath	the candles made the whole bathroom smell great and the water was awesome on my skin .

screv_get_dressed_bath	then toweled off and put on my pajamas to get ready for bed .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bath	how you take a bath varies a bit with what type of bathing facilities you have .
unrelev_bath	i 'm going to describe the typical definition of a bath .
screv_enter_bathroom_bath	go to your tub and take the shower curtain out of the tub if it is inside it .
unrelev_bath	you do n't want it to get wet !
screv_turn_water_on_bath	before you close the drain you should turn on the water and let it run for a little bit so you can get it to the right temperature
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	before you start filling the tub .
unrelev_bath	if you have somewhere to store the water you can place a bucket under the warming water and use it for another purpose .
screv_close_drain_bath	conservation ! once the water coming from the tap is at the temperature you like you can place the stopper in the drain and start filling the tub .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	make sure you do n't fill the tub all the way to the top because the water will displace once you get into the tub .
screv_sink_water_bath	you can also get in as the tub is filling so you can make a better judgment about
screv_turn_water_off_bath	when to turn off the water .
relnscrev_bath	while you are in the tub you should take a wash cloth
screv_wash_bath	and soap or bodywash to give yourself a good scrub down .
screv_wash_bath	if you need to wash your hair it is often better to do it after your bath .
screv_wash_bath	you can put the shampoo in your hair
relnscrev_bath	and as the tub empties place your head under the faucet to rinse out the soap .
unrelev_bath	enjoy your bath !
unrelev_bath	, this one was a little tough . i was n't sure how much detail to go into about taking the bath versus setting up the bath .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bath	it was a hard day , so i looked forward to making myself the perfect bath .
unrelev_bath	i get home from work
screv_enter_bathroom_bath	and head straight for the bathtub .
relnscrev_bath	i run the water until it 's the perfect temperature
screv_close_drain_bath	and plug the drain to allow the water to fill the tub .
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	i take some bath salts and oils to drizzle underneath the stream of water to allow it to dissolve and it fills the room with gentle fragrance .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	as the tub continues to fill with water ,
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i grab some candles and carefully place them around the tub .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	after lighting the candles and setting up a towel
screv_get_out_bath_bath	and robe for getting out ,
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i put on some quiet music to drown out the sound of my husband 's hockey game .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i grab a small towel to use as a pillow for my neck
screv_sink_water_bath	and finally get in the bath .
screv_relax_bath	i feel like i 'm melting as i shut my eyes and allow myself to relax .
unrelev_bath	i do n't realize how long i 'm in there until i open my eyes and see my husband standing over me .
relnscrev_bath	the water has lost all its warmth .
unrelev_bath	he had put the towel in the dryer and it was now warm , fluffy , and welcoming .
screv_get_out_bath_bath	i step out of the day as my troubles swirl down the drain .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bath	i like taking a bath instead of a shower sometimes .
screv_close_drain_bath	i start by closing the drain at the bottom of the tub .
screv_close_drain_bath	some tubs have a stopper and some have a thing you push down to close it .
screv_close_drain_bath	after it 's closed i like to run both hot and cold water to make warm water and then i let the tub fill up to about a hand 's height from the top of the tub .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	while the water is running ,
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i squirt in bubbles and make sure i have a clean washcloth and towel .
screv_sink_water_bath	after i carefully climb into the tub , i make sure i wash my whole body with the soap and washcloth , even behind my ears and between my toes .
relnscrev_bath	then i can either soak and relax in the tub or i can play with toys .
unrelev_bath	fun toys for the bathtub are boats and plastic water animals like whales and ducks .
relnscrev_bath	once the water starts to turn a little cold , it 's time to get out so i open the drain again and let the water empty out .
relnscrev_bath	while it 's draining i carefully stand up and reach for my towel to dry off .
relnscrev_bath	i always be sure the tub is clean when i 'm finished ,
relnscrev_bath	with toys and the dirty washcloth put where they belong .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bath	i prefer showers
evoking_bath	but sometimes you just need to take a bath .
unrelev_bath	showers are good for when you are really dirty and need to get cleaned fast but baths are more leisurely and relaxing .
screv_enter_bathroom_bath	first i go in the bathroom
screv_close_drain_bath	and put a stopper in the bathtub to stop the water from running out .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	then i start the water to fill up the tub .
screv_check_temp_bath	i also make sure it is just right , not too hot or cold .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	then i get my face cloth and a great big bar of soap .
relnscrev_bath	if i feel playful i will grab a couple water toys to play with .
screv_sink_water_bath	then i slip -lrb- off my clothes and slip into the tub .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	i fill the tub really high so only my head sticks out above the water .
unrelev_bath	i like the hot water all over me .
relnscrev_bath	i will spend an hour soaking in the tub .
screv_relax_bath	i will sit there till my fingers get all shrivelled and pruney .
relnscrev_bath	then i use my toes to take out the stopper and sit there till the water all drains away .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bath	last night , i took a bath .
relnscrev_bath	i take baths when i have time to relax and soak in bubbles .
unrelev_bath	baths are important for good hygiene and self esteem .
unrelev_bath	i always feel so much better when i am clean and smell like my favorite soap .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	i like to fill the tub up as full as i can and pick a shower gel or bubble bath to make lots and lots of bubbles .
relnscrev_bath	i just soak in the bubbles
screv_relax_bath	and enjoy the time to myself .
screv_wash_bath	then i wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner .
screv_wash_bath	next , i make sure to scrub everywhere from between my toes to behind my ears with soap .
screv_get_dressed_bath	after that , i am ready to dry off and get into some clean clothes .
unrelev_bath	if i do n't have time for a bath , i just take a shower .
unrelev_bath	showers are much faster !
unclear_bath	no matter what i choose , i make sure to take a bath or a shower every day .
<end_of_story>
screv_enter_bathroom_bath	i went into my bathroom and started to run the bath , letting the water get warm enough .
screv_close_drain_bath	once warm , i plugged up the drain and the bath began to fill .
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	i dripped some bubble bath into the water to get it nice and bubbly .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	suds filled the tub along with warm water , creating a heavenly scent .
unrelev_bath	once the tub was filled ,
screv_sink_water_bath	i disrobed and got in .
screv_relax_bath	i sat for a moment , relaxing , allowing the warm water to sooth my skin .
relnscrev_bath	after a few moments , i grabbed a bar of soap
screv_wash_bath	and lathered my body .
screv_wash_bath	i washed myself carefully
relnscrev_bath	because i did not want to spill water onto the floor .
relnscrev_bath	i washed my hair and dunked my head under water to clear the shampoo and conditioner .
relnscrev_bath	after awhile the water began to cool .
screv_wash_bath	since i was done washing ,
screv_open_drain_bath	i unplugged the drain and let the water drain out .
screv_dry_bath	i grabbed a towel and dried off .

screv_close_drain_bath	by flipping up the lever below the faucet .

screv_turn_water_on_bath	then i turn on the hot and cold water until it comes out of the faucet at a temperature i like , then make the water a little bit hotter

<end_of_story>
screv_enter_bathroom_bath	i was sitting on my couch when i decided that i had n't taken a bath in a while so i stood up and walked to the bathroom
screv_turn_water_on_bath	where i turned on the faucet in the sink and began filling the bath with hot water .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	while the tub was filling with hot water i put some bubble bath into the stream of hot water coming out of the faucet so that the tubbed filled with not only hot water , but bubbles .
screv_turn_water_off_bath	once the tub was almost to the top i turned off the water
relnscrev_bath	so that none of the water would overflow onto the bathroom floor .
screv_sink_water_bath	i got undressed and entered the tub ,
screv_check_temp_bath	making sure that it 's not very hot .
screv_relax_bath	i relax in the tub until i am happy with my bath
screv_dry_bath	and then i get out and dry off with a towel and then get dressed and laid down in my bed and took a nap , feeling very relaxed , content , and happy .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bath	it 's been a while since i have taken a bath ,
relnscrev_bath	i usually shower .
evoking_bath	when i do bathe , i tend to make a big deal of it , with bubble bath or bath oil ,
screv_relax_bath	and book to read in the tub , and very hot water .
unrelev_bath	some bubble bath comes in carnation fragrance , and sometimes i have a packet in one of the bathroom drawers .
unrelev_bath	if i have one ,
screv_close_drain_bath	i put in the bathtub plug
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	and open the packet and empty it under the bath tap .
screv_turn_water_on_bath	i turn on only the hot water , because at my house it starts out cold and only gradually heats up .
screv_check_temp_bath	i do test the temperature on my arm and adjust it
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	as the tub fills .
screv_take_clean_clothes_bath	i get fresh clothes and put them on the counter .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i also get an old paperback book , and put it by the tub .
screv_undress_bath	finally i undress ,
screv_undress_bath	and usually put the clothes i 'm taking off in the hamper .
unrelev_bath	i do all this rather slowly ,
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	because the tub fills so slowly .
screv_sink_water_bath	i climb in carefully , and again slowly , because the water is so hot .
screv_sink_water_bath	i slither down in the tub ,
relnscrev_bath	so i am buried in suds .
relnscrev_bath	then i pick up my book and start to read .
screv_wash_bath	chances are , unless i 'm really grubby i wont scrub until the bubbles start to diminish , if then .
screv_relax_bath	i just let the heat soak into me .
screv_wash_bath	finally i wash , emphasizing body folds ,
relnscrev_bath	using just bar soap , no washcloth .
screv_open_drain_bath	i drain the bath tub
screv_get_out_bath_bath	and stand up ,
relnscrev_bath	and sometimes i 'll shower quickly to refresh myself ,
screv_relax_bath	because i 'm so relaxed i could fall asleep where i stand .

unrelev_bath	when the tub was full enough ,
screv_sink_water_bath	i turned off the water and got into the tub , being careful not to slip on the slippery porcelain .
screv_relax_bath	i lay back in the warm water and shut my eyes , relaxing .
relnscrev_bath	when the water started to get cold ,
screv_get_towel_bath	i stood up and grabbed the towel from the curtain rod .
screv_dry_bath	i draped it around myself
screv_open_drain_bath	and then opened the tub 's drain
relnscrev_bath	so the water could drain out .
screv_get_dressed_bath	i went off to get dressed ,
relnscrev_bath	and when i was done i went back to the bathroom and turned the shower on for a minute so the bubbles would all go down the drain .
relnscrev_bath	i picked up my rubber ducky and gave him a squeeze until he quacked .
relnscrev_bath	then i put him on the shelf until next time .
<end_of_story>
screv_relax_bath	for me there is nothing more relaxing then taking a nice hot bath after a long day of work .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	when i got home the first thing i did was start the running water in the tub .

relnscrev_bath	i then went to my room
screv_take_clean_clothes_bath	and got some clean clothes and a towel from the closet .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i like to listen to music when i take a bath so i brought along my i-pod and small speakers .
screv_turn_water_off_bath	when the tub was almost filled i stop the water ,
screv_prepare_bath_bath	turned the music on ,
screv_sink_water_bath	and stepped inside the tub .
unrelev_bath	it was like a little piece of heaven
screv_relax_bath	as the warm water washed over my body .

<end_of_story>
evoking_bath	i love taking baths !
screv_relax_bath	they are so relaxing after a long day .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	when i get home from work , often , the first thing i do is start to fill the bathtub .
screv_check_temp_bath	i set the water temperature to a nice warm setting .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	while the tub is filling ,
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i will gather two fluffy towels and a face cloth .
relnscrev_bath	i also pour myself a glass of ice water to sip on
screv_relax_bath	while i 'm soaking .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i go and grab the latest magazine that i 've been waiting to read and put it next to the tub .

<end_of_story>
unrelev_bath	i prefer a shower over a bath ,
screv_relax_bath	but when i need to take a bath it 's to relax from a stressful evening .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	taking a bath requires filling the whole tub up with warm water .
relnscrev_bath	this may take some time and i will have to be sure to have a stopper to prevent the water from draining away from the tub .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	while the water is filling up ,
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	i will add the bubble bath solution to make the water soapy and fragrant .
screv_relax_bath	the aroma in the bath is what de-stresses me .
relnscrev_bath	usually it 'll be a nice lavender smell or something not too strong but is very pleasant to smell .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	once the tub is filled ,
screv_sink_water_bath	i will slowly enter myself into the water .
unrelev_bath	this can be tough at first because the water is usually too hot in the beginning
relnscrev_bath	so i will ease myself in .
screv_relax_bath	but once in , the bath will really work to help get the blood circulating to get a nice feeling of relaxation .
screv_relax_bath	i will typically stay in until the water is no longer warm or the bubbles have gone away .
unrelev_bath	so when the water is just lukewarm ,
screv_open_drain_bath	i will drain the tub
relnscrev_bath	and then rinse off using the normal shower .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bath	i thought about taking my usual shower today , but decided to take a bath instead .

screv_prepare_bath_bath	i get everything ready that i will need-my towel , my bath beads , a book and a candle .
screv_turn_water_on_bath	i run the water just a bit on the warm side since i do n't want the bath getting cold too soon .
screv_close_drain_bath	i put the stopper in on the bath drain
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	and then pour in my bath beads .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	time to run the water .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i 've lit my candle and grabbed my book .

relnscrev_bath	i will get through a chapter or two of my book , depending how fast i feel like reading .
screv_relax_bath	the whole atmosphere is de-stressing me .
screv_get_dressed_bath	after my bath , i will towel off and get into my pajamas .
evoking_bath	i always seem to sleep better after taking a relaxing bath .
<end_of_story>
screv_wash_bath	every day i wash myself in one form or another .
unrelev_bath	it is imperative to stay clean and hygienic .
evoking_bath	last night i decided to switch up my normal routine of taking a shower , and decided to take a nice bubble bath !
screv_prepare_bath_bath	to prepare for the luscious endeavor , i stopped at lush on my way home from work .
relnscrev_bath	lush has a variety of ` bath bombs ' that can be used to enhance a bath .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i found a dragonfruit-passionberry bomb , and purchased it .
relnscrev_bath	although i am a straight man , i love to pamper myself .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	getting home , the first thing i did was turn the hot water on in the bath to fill it up .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	the warm water filled the tub
relnscrev_bath	and tendrils of mist rose from the steamy water .
relnscrev_bath	the warmth was positively inviting !
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	i dropped the bath bomb in
screv_sink_water_bath	and stepped into the tub myself .
screv_sink_water_bath	lowering myself slowly into the water 's embrace ,
screv_relax_bath	i relaxed fully .
relnscrev_bath	after spending 23 minutes and becoming a pruny mass , my bath was complete and my whole persona was now clean .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bath	sometimes after a long , hard , stressful day at the office , the best thing to do when you get home is to take a nice , hot , relaxing bubble bath !
unrelev_bath	that is exactly what i did after coming home on monday afternoon .
screv_relax_bath	i decided i would make it as relaxing as possible and pretend that i was at a spa .
screv_enter_bathroom_bath	i went up to the bathroom and started to draw the warm water into the tub .
relnscrev_bath	while that was filling up i then went down to the kitchen
screv_relax_bath	and grabbed a bottle of wine and a glass and took it upstairs to sip as i soaked .
screv_relax_bath	to complete my ultimate relaxation bath night i grabbed my blue tooth speaker and set it up to play some relaxing music while i was in the tub .
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	i then added some bubble bath
screv_sink_water_bath	and got in .
screv_wash_bath	first i washed my hair and then my body and then it was time to relax and soak until my skin started to look like a raisin .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bath	taking a bath is a delightful experience .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i first set the scene by putting on some music , maybe even some candles if i 'm feeling particularly luxurious .
relnscrev_bath	some people like to have a glass of wine or two , but i prefer a refreshing diet coke in my bath .
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	i like trying out different bath bombs and bath melts from beauty stores like lush ,
relnscrev_bath	they scent the water , create bubbles and contribute to an overall pleasant experience .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	i fill the bath with warm to hot water , since i like to bathe after a good workout
unclear_bath	and my sore body appreciates the heat .
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	if i 'm using bubble bath i can pour it in with the water , if i 'm using a bath bomb i crumble it in little by little .
screv_sink_water_bath	once the water is at an appropriate depth i turn off the faucet and sink into bliss .
relnscrev_bath	i let myself soak until the water cools too much and by then i feel refreshed and content .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bath	as a child , i loved taking baths .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	my mother always had to fill the tub for me so that the water would not be too hot or too cold .

evoking_bath	my favorite part of taking a bath was the bubbles .

screv_open_drain_bath	after draining the water ,

<end_of_story>
evoking_bath	when i have a long day at work , i like to take a bath before i go to bed .

screv_turn_water_on_bath	i start my bath by turning on the warm water faucet .
screv_close_drain_bath	then i plug the drain
relnscrev_bath	so the water will stay in the tub .
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	sometimes i pour some bubble bath into the tub .
unrelev_bath	when i do this ,
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	i pour a little bit of bubble bath liquid under the running water .
unrelev_bath	whenever the tub is about halfway full of water ,
screv_sink_water_bath	i get in the tub
screv_relax_bath	and relax .

evoking_bath	it was this mind frame that led me to take my third bath of the day a few minutes ago .
unrelev_bath	i had decided to go outside and shoot my assault rifle and do some pistol drills since it was such a warm and beautiful day outside .
unrelev_bath	the sweat started coming from my body as i trained hard and the spent gunpowder began to cling to my sweat moistened skin .

screv_enter_bathroom_bath	i tiptoed towards the bathroom , where i knew a relaxing bath was in my future .

screv_other_bath_bath	i would occasionally lift my feet up to the top of the bathtub to get a nice stretch .

screv_relax_bath	after getting comfy i close my eyes and relax for 23 or 23 minutes before beginning to get clean and proceed to get out .
screv_wash_bath	after cleaning i do not like to relax any longer because you are basically sitting in your dirt , grime , and filth .

unrelev_bath	no matter how warm or cozy the water still seems .
<end_of_story>

screv_other_bath_bath	rubbing down my legs and arms felt pretty good and made the tub smell even nicer .
relnscrev_bath	i then sat back and cleared my mind , letting my skin soak in the oils .

relnscrev_bath	i wanted to be able to relax and get clean without all the work of standing up to shower !
relnscrev_bath	first , i made sure the bathtub was cleaned out .
screv_turn_water_on_bath	i then ran the hot water first
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	and filled up most of the bathtub .
screv_turn_water_off_bath	i turned the hot water off
screv_turn_water_on_bath	and then turned the cold on , that way the temperature of the water was not too hot and not too cold , but just right .
screv_sink_water_bath	i got a book that i had been wanting to read and climbed in .
screv_wash_bath	after reading for awhile , i decided that it was time to wash off since the water was starting to cool down .

evoking_bath	the first time i took a bath , i enjoyed it so much that i did not want to stop .
unrelev_bath	it felt like i was sitting in a pool of warm water .
unrelev_bath	i was a young kid so it was a bubble bath and i had some toys to play with .
screv_wash_bath	either my mother or my father would wash my hair for me then they would help me wash the remainder of my body .
relnscrev_bath	but they just told me not to splash the water and to keep the water in the tub .
unrelev_bath	i would play with my toys and get all clean in the bath tub .
screv_wash_bath	after a few years i learned how to wash my own hair and i would prefer to take a bath over a shower since it was more fun to sit and relax in the warm water and enjoy a fun evening .
evoking_bath	from the best of my memory , i remember that i always loved taking a bath .
unrelev_bath	then when i am done in the bath tub ,
screv_get_towel_bath	i would get out and wrap up in a huge dry cotton towel
screv_dry_bath	and dry off !
<end_of_story>

screv_prepare_bath_bath	first i moved my soap and shampoo down to the side of the tub instead of on their normal shower shelf ,
relnscrev_bath	then started the water running .
unrelev_bath	once i got it hot , but not too hot ,
screv_close_drain_bath	i closed the drain
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	so the tub would start to fill up .
unrelev_bath	i had an idea at the last minute and grabbed my tablet and a ziploc bag and put the tablet inside it to protect it from splashes .
unrelev_bath	i turned up my stereo so i could head it in the bathroom ,
screv_sink_water_bath	then got into the tub .
unrelev_bath	i settled into the warm water
screv_relax_bath	and relaxed for a little while , then grabbed my tablet and started reading a book .
screv_relax_bath	after about 23 minutes of relaxing ,
relnscrev_bath	i let some of the water out since it was getting cold ,
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	filled up with more hot water and started washing .
screv_open_drain_bath	once i was cleaned off , i opened the drain and finished up by washing my hair under the shower .
unrelev_bath	it was a nice change from showering all the time .
<end_of_story>
screv_relax_bath	after a long day , nothing really relaxes me like a long ,
relnscrev_bath	soaking bath .

screv_turn_water_on_bath	first i 'll get home and start the tub 23 i like the water to be hot to the point of nearly scalding ,
screv_other_bath_bath	so i only add a tiny bit of cold water .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	as the tub fills ,
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i get together what i call my bath toys , which consist of my kindle and an ice cold beer .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	when the tub is full i get my favorite sweat pants and sweatshirt together and ,
screv_undress_bath	after getting undressed ,
screv_sink_water_bath	i slowly lower myself into the tub , savoring every twitch
screv_sink_water_bath	as i lower myself into the scalding water .
unrelev_bath	once i 'm settled , i crack open my beer and then just enjoy the feeling of all of the tension leaving my muscles as i read .
relnscrev_bath	when the water cools off -lrb- this can take 23 minutes or more -rrb- i get out of the tub ,
screv_get_dressed_bath	dry off and get dressed , but not without a slight feeling of disappointment that the experience has ended .

relnscrev_bath	i glanced at myself in the mirror and realized that i was much dirtier than i thought .
evoking_bath	i figured i should take a bath before doing anything else
relnscrev_bath	so as to not soil anything in my home .
screv_turn_water_off_bath	i turned off the sink ,
screv_dry_bath	dried my hands ,
screv_prepare_bath_bath	and set off in search of a bath towel and a change of clothes .
screv_relax_bath	i decided on a bath as i had a long day and it sounded so much more relaxing .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	once i had the items i needed ,
screv_enter_bathroom_bath	i went back to the bathroom
screv_turn_water_on_bath	and turned the tub on .
screv_turn_water_on_bath	i turned the hot and cold nozzles both ,
relnscrev_bath	and adjusted them as needed after testing the temperature with my hand .
screv_turn_water_off_bath	once the tub was half full i turned it off , as i knew my body weight would displace the water and cause the level to rise once i got in .
screv_sink_water_bath	i sat down in the perfectly warm water
screv_relax_bath	and relaxed .
relnscrev_bath	once the water started cooling down , i decided to go ahead and wash myself .
screv_apply_soap_bath	i poured some bodywash on a cloth
screv_wash_bath	and washed from the top down .
screv_dry_bath	then , i rinsed and drained the tub and dried off .
evoking_bath	that 's how i took a bath .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bath	there 's nothing i love more
evoking_bath	after a long day at work then to come home to a warm bath .
evoking_bath	most people think that taking a bath is a simple process .
unrelev_bath	oh how they are wrong .
evoking_bath	taking a bath is actually a long process involving many steps .
screv_turn_water_on_bath	first i must start drawing the water which is a challenge in itself as i want to make sure it warm , but not too warm .
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	next as the water is still running i add a little bit of bubble soap for the added benefits .
screv_relax_bath	but i do n't just want bubbles i want a relaxing aromatherapy .
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	with this in mind i add a little bit of essential oils and minerals .
screv_sink_water_bath	finally i am ready to get into the water .
unrelev_bath	but this is nowhere near the end of the process .
screv_relax_bath	now i relax in the water
relnscrev_bath	while reading my novel and letting the oils soak into my skin .
screv_relax_bath	ah this is how we are meant to relax .
<end_of_story>
screv_relax_bath	i had spent the day planting a tree and needed to take a bath to clean myself and relax those tired muscles .
screv_enter_bathroom_bath	i went to the bathroom
screv_turn_water_on_bath	and turned on the faucet in the bathtub .
relnscrev_bath	once the water reached the temperature that i wanted i plugged the drain to fill the bathtub .
relnscrev_bath	while the tub was filling up i undressed myself and put the dirty soiled clothing in the the hamper .
screv_turn_water_off_bath	i turned the water off
screv_relax_bath	and got into the nice hot relaxing tub of water .
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	i added some bath soap into the tub and proceeded to scrub the dirt off my body with a washcloth .
screv_open_drain_bath	after washing myself and relaxing a bit i unclog the drain and watch the dirty soapy water spiral down the drain .
screv_wash_bath	i rinse body quickly in the shower to rinse the soap off .
screv_dry_bath	i get out and grab a towel to dry myself .
screv_get_dressed_bath	i put on a clean set of clothes
relnscrev_bath	and feel fresh .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bath	last night , i decided to take a bath .
relnscrev_bath	i usually take a shower instead , but my muscles felt sore and i thought i could use a bath with some epsom salt .
evoking_bath	the epsom salt bath is really good at soothing sore muscles ,
screv_relax_bath	plus it is very relaxing .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	i ran a very hot bath
screv_put_bubble_bath_scent_bath	and poured some epsom salt in
relnscrev_bath	so it could dissolve .
screv_fill_water/wait_bath	while the bath was running ,
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i grabbed a towel and a book i was reading .
screv_prepare_bath_bath	i set it all up next to the tub
screv_undress_bath	and undressed .
screv_sink_water_bath	i slid into the hot water
relnscrev_bath	and felt the salt granules prickling my skin ,
screv_relax_bath	as my muscles finally relaxed .
relnscrev_bath	after some time , the water cooled ,
screv_turn_water_on_bath	so i added some more hot water .
screv_other_bath_bath	i stayed in the bathtub for about 23 minutes ,
relnscrev_bath	until my muscles felt better .
unrelev_bath	when i was finally done ,
relnscrev_bath	i drained the cooled water ,
screv_dry_bath	toweled off ,
screv_get_dressed_bath	and got dressed .
