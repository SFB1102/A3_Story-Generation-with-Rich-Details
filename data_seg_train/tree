unrelev_tree	my family recently moved to a new home with a bland and boring yard .
evoking_tree	we decided to plant some trees to spice up the place , so my mother , father , siblings and i all packed ourselves into the suv and drove to a nearby nursery .
screv_choose_tree_tree	we looked at many different types of trees before settling on the apple trees .
screv_get_tree_tree	we bought several baby apple trees
screv_take_home_tree	and took them home for planting .
screv_dig_hole_tree	first , my father and older brother dug large holes in the ground .
unrelev_tree	i wanted to help , but they said i was too young to hold the shovel !
screv_dig_hole_tree	after the holes were dug ,
screv_place_root_tree	the apple trees were placed inside .
screv_refill_hole_tree	then , we shoveled dirt into the holes to fix the apple trees in place .
unrelev_tree	i was allowed to help with that , thankfully .
relnscrev_tree	after all that , our baby apple trees were planted in the ground and we were all very excited to see what they would look like as they grew up .

screv_get_tree_tree	when i was a freshman in high school we each had the opportunity to buy an inexpensive tree as part of the arbor day holiday .
evoking_tree	part of the proceeds for the purchase were going to plant more trees in town .
evoking_tree	the tree i had was some kind of evergreen tree and i planned to plant it in the front yard .
unrelev_tree	i asked my dad
screv_find_place_tree	where it 'd be best to plant it and we picked a spot where there were some flowers , but no trees .
relnscrev_tree	in order to plant it i read the instructions that came with the tree and started by digging a hole that was about twice the size of the root ball of the tree .
unrelev_tree	it was a small tree so this was not a big hole .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i then tried to make the hole a good shape
screv_refill_hole_tree	before putting in some moss and fill dirt .
screv_water_tree	i watered the tree that day and made sure to water it each day for about a week until we had a good rain .
relnscrev_tree	the tree grew and became quite large .
unrelev_tree	the one thing i did n't realize is that i should have planned better for how big the tree was going to get because it ended up shadowing over the flower planters a bit .
<end_of_story>
screv_find_place_tree	the first step to planting a tree is to find a suitable spot for the tree .
relnscrev_tree	one thing many people do not think about is the amount of airspace needed once the tree actually starts growing .
relnscrev_tree	make sure there are know power-lines or other objects that may be affected the growing tree .
screv_find_place_tree	after a suitable spot is found ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	get a shovel and dig a whole large enough to cover the entire base off the tree with at least six inches of soil to spare on top of the trees root bulb .
screv_dig_hole_tree	when the hole is dug ,
relnscrev_tree	shake some of the loose dirt from the tree 's root bulb
screv_dig_hole_tree	and then place the tree into the newly created hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	pack the area around the hole
screv_dig_hole_tree	and tree bulb with some of the dirt that was excavated from the hole .
screv_water_tree	water the hole , the use the shovel to pat the area around the tree down .
screv_water_tree	water the area one more time .

unrelev_tree	i am an avid gardener .
unrelev_tree	i have a large garden and lots of flower beds .
evoking_tree	but this year i wanted to plant some small fruit trees in my garden .
unrelev_tree	i went to the nursery
screv_choose_tree_tree	and picked out a small dwarf apple tree i wanted to plant .
unrelev_tree	the tree was young and was basically a very small trunk with two branches .
relnscrev_tree	i brought it home and read the instructions for planting it .
screv_dig_hole_tree	the whole i needed to dig was 23 inches across and 23 foot deep .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i used my garden shovel to break up the grass and dig the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i saved the dirt in my wheelbarrow to put back in the whole when i was done .
screv_place_root_tree	i put the small tree in the whole
screv_water_tree	and filled the hole with water .
screv_water_tree	when the water had saturated the earth i
screv_refill_hole_tree	then shoveled thew leftover dirt back in the hole .
unrelev_tree	i was finished in about 23 mintes .
screv_get_tree_tree	i think i will get several more fruit trees to plant .
unrelev_tree	it was very easy to do .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	i planted a tree for arbor day last year .
screv_find_place_tree	the first thing i did was decide where i want to plant my tree and i chose a nice spot in my backyard .
screv_choose_tree_tree	then i decided what kind of tree i wanted .
unrelev_tree	i thought a shady tree would be nice in that spot ,
relnscrev_tree	so i went to a tree place called a nursery and picked out a nice young tree called a sapling
screv_take_home_tree	and i loaded into the back of my truck to take home .
unrelev_tree	once i was at home again ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	i got my shovel and dug a hole in the right spot in the backyard .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	then i unwrapped the trees roots and very ,
screv_place_root_tree	very carefully place the tree into the hole .
unrelev_tree	the roots at the bottom are called a root ball and is made of the roots and dirt that protects the roots .
unrelev_tree	i was very careful not to knock the dirt off so the roots would n't be damaged .
screv_place_root_tree	once the root ball was settled into the hole
relnscrev_tree	and the tree was standing up straight ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	i filled the hole up with dirt again
screv_water_tree	and then watered the tree .
relnscrev_tree	my tree is healthy and growing because i was careful with it .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	today is arbor day
evoking_tree	and i am going to plant a tree to celebrate .
screv_get_tree_tree	my mother bought an apple tree at the plant store for me .
relnscrev_tree	she helped me carry it outside to plant .
screv_find_place_tree	i had to pick the perfect spot for my tree .
unrelev_tree	i decided it would look really nice over by the swing set .
screv_find_place_tree	i picked a spot far enough away that the apples would n't fall on my swing set , though .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i got a shovel and dug a really deep hole .
unrelev_tree	it took me a long time !
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	then my mom helped me put a little bit of fertilizer in the hole .
relnscrev_tree	fertilizer helps the tree grow .
screv_place_root_tree	the next thing i did was put the bottom of the tree into the hole
screv_refill_hole_tree	and cover the root ball up with dirt .
relnscrev_tree	finally , i took the water hose
screv_water_tree	and sprayed the dirt around the bottom of the tree with water .
relnscrev_tree	i ca n't wait to see my new tree grow bigger and bigger !
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	recently , my kids reminded me that arbor day was approaching .
unrelev_tree	i always wanted to do something in honor of my mom ,
relnscrev_tree	and why not plant a tree that i could watch grow in our backyard .
unrelev_tree	the tree would help with the arbor day festivities , as well as be a memory tree that is in dedication of my mom .
relnscrev_tree	we went to our local home improvement store in search of the perfect tree for our task .
screv_choose_tree_tree	the kids decided that we should have some sort of fruit tree , and what better tree than an orange tree , because after all we do live in florida .
screv_get_tree_tree	once we got the tree , a worker assisted us in loading the tree onto my truck , and home bound we were .
screv_take_home_tree	once we got home ,
screv_find_place_tree	we decided on a spot for the tree ,
screv_place_root_tree	and began to dig a hole to place the tree into .
screv_place_root_tree	we placed the tree in the hole ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	and then covered back up the hole .
screv_water_tree	we then watered the tree , and the process of watching the tree grow began .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	every year we celebrate arbor day .
evoking_tree	last year we we decided to celebrate the holiday by planing a tree .
relnscrev_tree	we went to the local plant nursery .
relnscrev_tree	we talked to the employees to find out which trees grow well in our area and in the type of soil we have .
screv_choose_tree_tree	we chose a small maple seedling .
screv_take_home_tree	when we got home ,
screv_find_place_tree	we chose an area of our yard with lots of sun .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we dug a hole just a little bigger than the roots of our seedling .
screv_place_root_tree	we put the seedling in the hole in the ground very carefully ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	then covered the roots with dirt .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	we patted the dirt down really good to make sure the little tree seedling would be stable in the ground when it was windy .
screv_water_tree	then we watered the tree .
screv_water_tree	we 've been watching and watering our tree for a year
relnscrev_tree	and slowly but surely our little tree is growing .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	my friend , tom , had moved into a new house , and decided to plant a small tree to help make his yard look better .
relnscrev_tree	he had been advised by a tree expert , that the best time to plant it was in april or may .
evoking_tree	so about several weeks after tom had moved into his new home , he went ahead to plant the tree in mid april .
screv_dig_hole_tree	he first got and checked some maps to make sure he did n't mistakenly end up digging into any telephone or gas lines .
screv_find_place_tree	once he found a suitable spot to plant his new tree ,
screv_get_tools_tree	tom took a shovel and began preparing the hole to place it in .
relnscrev_tree	next , he prepared the tree for planting by turning carefully upside down to remove it from the pot it came in .
screv_place_root_tree	he then gently , placed the tree into the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	tom also filled the hole with some compost and manure to help the tree grow better .
unrelev_tree	once this was done ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	he filled up the hole completely
screv_water_tree	and watered the tree .
relnscrev_tree	finally , he placed mulch on top and then stopped to admire the beautiful new tree in his yard .

evoking_tree	my classmates and i needed to plant a nice tree in front of the new school building that was just built this year .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i wanted to find a tree that would last a quite long time .
screv_choose_tree_tree	we found a nice pine tree that was just large enough to be a foot .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we dug a nice hole in the ground , and insured the soil was the proper type to accept a tree of this size .
unrelev_tree	it had to be nice and soft , and in a safe location where kids wo n't trample over it .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i dug the hole about 23 '' '' deep and insured it was wide enough for the tree .
screv_place_root_tree	we planted the tree and began to fill in the surrounding area of it with soil to make sure it would hold in place as perfect as possible .
unrelev_tree	the tree looked perfect and was ready to withstand the first school year outside the new building .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	i wanted to plant an apple tree in my yard .
unrelev_tree	i thought that my children would enjoy the apples for many years to come .
screv_choose_tree_tree	after picking the perfect tree
screv_take_home_tree	and bringing it home , i backed my car into the area that i wanted to plant the tree in .
relnscrev_tree	i unloaded the tree and waled to my garage
screv_get_tools_tree	and got a shovel and pulled the garden hose over to the tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i dug a very large hole
screv_water_tree	and filled it with water .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	i unwrapped the burlap from around the root ball of the tree
screv_place_root_tree	and placed the tree into the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i filled the hole back in with dirt
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	and patted the soil down firmly .
screv_water_tree	i watered the soil around the base of the tree .
unrelev_tree	i will now wait to enjoy fresh crisp apples from my apple tree , hoping that my hard work is worth it .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	on the weekend i planted an apple an apple tree .
screv_get_tools_tree	first , i put on gardening gloves to protect my hands .
screv_dig_hole_tree	next , i used a small shovel to dig a hole in a patch of dirt in my backyard .
relnscrev_tree	i then took an apple seed
screv_place_root_tree	and placed it inside the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	next , i took the soil that i had dug out earlier and placed it on top of the seed , creating a thin layer of soil on top of the seed .
screv_get_tools_tree	i then took my watering can over to the water hose and used the hose to fill the can up with water .
unrelev_tree	when the can was full ,
screv_get_tools_tree	i brought it back over to the patch of dirt where the apple seed was planted ,
screv_water_tree	and i gently poured the water from the watering can onto the patch of dirt , watering my newly-planted apple seed .
relnscrev_tree	i thought happily about how exciting it will be when my tiny apple seed grows into a huge apple tree .
<end_of_story>
screv_get_tree_tree	if you want to plant a tree it is best to get a small sapling .
screv_dig_hole_tree	dig yourself a hole
screv_place_root_tree	and put the saplings root ball in the hole .
unrelev_tree	you do not want to cut or break the roots
screv_place_root_tree	when you put it in the ground .
unrelev_tree	make sure your hole is big enough but not too deep .
unrelev_tree	you also do not want your hole to be too narrow .
relnscrev_tree	you can remove any dead or dried up roots from the ball .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	you now want to refill with dirt lightly tamping the dirt as you go .
relnscrev_tree	make a mound of dirt around the base of the tree with the dirt that no longer fits in the hole .
screv_water_tree	water the tree .
relnscrev_tree	it is a good idea to also add some sort of mulch to protect the dirt from washing away .
unrelev_tree	this will also help keep weeds from growing and help in keeping moisture to roots .
screv_water_tree	fertilize and water your newly planted tree .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	i love cherries .
unrelev_tree	i thought it would nice if i had a cherry tree in my backyard .
evoking_tree	there was plenty of room in my yard for a large tree , so i decided to plant one .
relnscrev_tree	i drove my pickup truck to a nursery near where i live .
unrelev_tree	they had many different types of trees there ,
relnscrev_tree	all growing in large pots .
unrelev_tree	the trees were very skinny , but i knew once they were out of the pots
screv_place_root_tree	and planted in the ground ,
relnscrev_tree	they would grow into large trees .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i found some cherry trees and saw how much they would cost .
relnscrev_tree	i asked a man who worked at the nursery
relnscrev_tree	if he would put the tree in my pickup
screv_get_tree_tree	after i paid for it .
unrelev_tree	i went to the cashier
screv_get_tree_tree	and paid for the tree and the man loaded it into my truck .
screv_take_home_tree	when i got home ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	i got a shovel and dug a huge hole
relnscrev_tree	where i wanted the tree to grow .
unrelev_tree	i made sure all the big rocks and roots from other trees were not left in the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i added some manure so the roots would get all the extra nutrients a growing tree would need .
unrelev_tree	in the middle of the hole i made the soil higher in the shape of an upside down cone .
relnscrev_tree	i took the tree out of my truck and removed it from the pot .
screv_place_root_tree	i stood the tree up in the middle of the hole , with the tree on the top of the cone and the roots spread out around it .
unrelev_tree	this would make sure the tree would not be standing in water and the roots could drink the water easily .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i replaced the dirt , making sure the tree was even with the ground around the hole .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	when the hole was all filled up i stomped all around the tree to make sure the roots of the tree were firmly connected with the soil .
unrelev_tree	when i was sure the tree was firmly in the ground and would not move ,
screv_get_tools_tree	i got my garden hose .
relnscrev_tree	i turned on the water
screv_water_tree	and slowly watered the tree .
screv_water_tree	after a few hours , i watered it again .
unrelev_tree	when all the water had sunk into the ground ,
relnscrev_tree	i put a few inches of mulch all around the tree to keep the roots moist and stop weeds from growing .
screv_water_tree	i knew that i would have to water the the tree every week until the roots got established .
unrelev_tree	the tree will get bigger every year , and i 'm looking forward to the day when i 'll be able to pick cherries in my own back yard !
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	when i looked out of my window into my back garden i decided i needed a tree to help provide some shade for my dogs while they are outside as it can get very hot where i live .
relnscrev_tree	i thought carefully about the type of tree i wanted to grow , i needed something with lots of leaves that would grow quite fast as i could n't afford to buy a tree that was already grown .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i did some research on the internet and decided that i would like a japanese maple tree with red leaves .
relnscrev_tree	i drove to the garden center and made my way to the tree section , where there were lots of lovely small japanese maples for sale already growing in pots .
relnscrev_tree	i found someone who worked there to advise me on the best way to plant the tree and how to care for it .
relnscrev_tree	after i had paid for it and chosen some special compost for trees , they helped me load the car
screv_take_home_tree	and i drove home to plant it .
screv_find_place_tree	i selected a good spot in the garden where it would have room to spread out and went into the garage to get my spade .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i dug a hole wide and deep enough for the entire pot to fit into ,
relnscrev_tree	and i laid the pot on it 's side , gently tugging on the tree to remove it from the pot .
unrelev_tree	once it was free ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	i shook the roots a little to free them up and planted the tree in the hole i had dug .
screv_refill_hole_tree	then i packed the sides of the roots with the compost , making sure the trunk stayed vertical as i was doing this .
screv_water_tree	when i had finished i watered the new tree really well , making a puddle around the base of the trunk with my garden hose .
unrelev_tree	then it was time to sit back and imagine in a few years i would have a big leafy red maple providing lots of shade and color .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	i decided we needed some fruit trees on our property
screv_get_tree_tree	so ordered a three in one apple tree from a catalog .
unrelev_tree	the three in one apple tree did n't need other apple trees for cross pollination because it had three different kinds of apples on its branches .
screv_get_tree_tree	a couple weeks later a the apple tree came in the mail .
relnscrev_tree	i opened the package and read the directions .
screv_get_tools_tree	i then grabbed a shovel and went and dug a hole that was twice as big as the base of the tree .
relnscrev_tree	then i drove to the store to buy some potting mix which was highly encouraged in the apple trees instructions .
screv_dig_hole_tree	once home , i put the three in one apple tree into the hole i had dug .
screv_refill_hole_tree	then i put potting soil around the base of the tree .
screv_water_tree	then all that was left to do was keep it watered throughout the year .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	my yard was very bare and plain-looking so i decided to add some trees to the landscape .
relnscrev_tree	first , i went to the local nursery and asked them for advice on what kinds of trees would do well in my area , level of sunlight , amount of precipitation , etc .
unrelev_tree	they gave me some ideas
screv_choose_tree_tree	and i picked out a bradford pear tree sapling .
screv_take_home_tree	i took it home and left it in shade while i prepared to plant it .
screv_dig_hole_tree	first i got out a shovel and dug a deep enough hole to cover the whole root ball of the tree .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	then i placed some fertilizer in the bottom of the hole .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	next i unwrapped the root ball from the burlap sack which contained it and placed it in the hole that i had dug .
unrelev_tree	once it was in ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	i shoveled the dirt back into the opening
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	and tamped it firmly around the base of the tree .
screv_water_tree	after that i placed a soaker hose near it to give it plenty of water .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	my friend 's yard needed some more shade to help make it cooler during the summer .
evoking_tree	we both decided to plant a tree to help with the problem .
relnscrev_tree	we went to the store
screv_get_tree_tree	and bought a small tree that we could plant and grow .
screv_take_home_tree	we then took it home .
evoking_tree	the next step was to plant it .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we had to dig up a hole in the backyard to plant it in .
unrelev_tree	we used shovels
relnscrev_tree	and a wheelbarrow to pick up the dirt and take it away .
unrelev_tree	when the hole was good enough ,
screv_place_root_tree	we planted the tree in the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	we then made sure to put back some of the dirt around the root and base of the tree to make sure it was secure .
unrelev_tree	after we were sure the tree was secure ,
screv_water_tree	my friend and i watered the area surrounding it to make sure it would grow properly .
unrelev_tree	we hope that the tree will offer some shade by next summer .

evoking_tree	before you plant a tree , you must contact the utility company .
unrelev_tree	they will come to your property and mark out utility lines .
unrelev_tree	without doing this ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	you may dig down and hit a line , which can be lethal !
screv_dig_hole_tree	once you know where to dig ,
screv_choose_tree_tree	select what type of tree you want .
relnscrev_tree	take things into consideration such as how much sun it gets , what zone you are in , and how quickly you want it to grow .
screv_dig_hole_tree	dig a hole large enough for the tree and roots .
screv_place_root_tree	place the tree in the hole
screv_refill_hole_tree	and then fill the hole back up with dirt .
unrelev_tree	many small trees will need support until they are bigger .
relnscrev_tree	this will ensure they grow tall and straight .
screv_water_tree	it is crucial to keep the tree watered !
unrelev_tree	it will need a lot of water at first .
unrelev_tree	mulch is helpful to keep the soil moist .
unrelev_tree	it 's also important to wait until the threat of a frost has passed or is not in the near future .
relnscrev_tree	giving care to your new tree will ensure that it will grow big and strong !

evoking_tree	my grandpa needed help recently planting a bunch of apple trees on his property .
relnscrev_tree	after going to the nursery ,
screv_find_place_tree	we picked a perfect place for them to go and made sure to place them the appropriate distance apart .
screv_get_tools_tree	we grabbed the shovels he had in his shed and started digging the holes .
screv_dig_hole_tree	after digging them all out ,
screv_place_root_tree	we carefully placed them into their spots and made sure to give them plenty of room
screv_refill_hole_tree	and filled the hole with nutrients and very fresh soil .
screv_water_tree	we made sure to give the newly planted trees plenty of water so that they would establish their roots very quickly
relnscrev_tree	and grow into very healthy trees .
evoking_tree	the first stage of planting a tree is the most important and we wanted to make sure to do it right .
unrelev_tree	after we were done ,

unrelev_tree	two days ago , it was earth day .
unrelev_tree	a few people were giving out seeds in order to project the idea of green living into people 's minds .
evoking_tree	my friend and i , joey , decided that we would help to plant a few trees in order to contribute to the efforts .
screv_get_tree_tree	we received a few tree saplings in the mail from a catalog .
evoking_tree	joey and i decided that we would plant them in our backyard to provide shade .
unrelev_tree	while the trees might be small now ,
relnscrev_tree	hopefully they would grow into big trees for maybe our kids .
relnscrev_tree	we got all down and dirty in the grass , starting to rake up a circle of grass in order to turn over some topsoil .
unrelev_tree	we had a trowel , and yes we called it a trowel ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	and we dug into the dirt to start planting the tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we made a six inch deep hole in the soil ,
screv_place_root_tree	and then put the tree in .
screv_refill_hole_tree	we finished by packing the soil down around the roots of the small tree ,
screv_water_tree	and then we watered it .

evoking_tree	planting a tree was one of the most difficult but memorable experiences of my life .
relnscrev_tree	when i decided i wanted to plant a tree i knew absolutely nothing about it , so my first step was to do some research .
evoking_tree	as it turns out , while it is possible to plant a tree from a seed , trees are most commonly planted in the for of saplings : small baby trees that come in pots .
relnscrev_tree	so i went to the home depot
screv_choose_tree_tree	and picked a tree .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i decided on an avocado tree because i love the buttery goodness of its fruit .
relnscrev_tree	i carefully packed the tree into my car
screv_get_tree_tree	and took it home ,
relnscrev_tree	where i brought it into my backyard
screv_dig_hole_tree	and dug a hole for it .
screv_dig_hole_tree	after i dug the hole ,
relnscrev_tree	i took the sapling out of the pot
screv_place_root_tree	and placed it into the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	finally i filled up the excess space with leftover dirt
screv_water_tree	and gave the tree a water in its new home .
<end_of_story>
screv_get_tree_tree	i bought a little flowering tree at a local greenhouse .
screv_get_tree_tree	it came with its roots bundled up in burlap , or something that looks like burlap .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i dug a hole about two feet deep in my front yard , where i wanted the tree to grow .
unrelev_tree	the instructions said to leave the roots in the bag .
unrelev_tree	the bag would naturally rot away with time and the roots would poke out of it
relnscrev_tree	as they grew .
screv_dig_hole_tree	once my hole was dug ,
relnscrev_tree	i moved the tree over to the spot
screv_place_root_tree	and put it in the hole .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i then started filling up the hole i 'd made with the dirt that i 'd dug up .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	i made sure the tree was standing straight and i tamped down the loose dirt by walking on it until the tree seemed to be firmly in place .
relnscrev_tree	i then put some mulch around the base of the tree in a circle .
unrelev_tree	that 's supposed to help the area retain moisture , which the tree needs to survive .
screv_water_tree	after that , i took out the hose and watered the tree a little to give it a good start in life .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	there are many ways to plant a tree .
evoking_tree	one of the least expensive is planting a bare root tree .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i had to chose the right tree for my area and my particular situation .
relnscrev_tree	my local nursery carries only plants suited to our area ,
relnscrev_tree	but since i bought from a catalog i checked for suitability in a sunset garden book .
screv_find_place_tree	i also had to site the tree properly .
relnscrev_tree	it could n't be under power lines , and needed room to spread .
evoking_tree	i finally planted a magnolia .
unrelev_tree	it began as a bare root tree ,
relnscrev_tree	and it now flowers every early spring , even in our drought .
screv_place_root_tree	first , i dug a planting hole .
relnscrev_tree	the hole was wider at the bottom than at the top , and had a cone of firm soil in its center to support the tree .
unrelev_tree	the hole was about five times as wide across as the tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i started the hole with a shovel , but finished by hacking at the soil underground with a spade to undercut the hole
relnscrev_tree	and so the roots could get purchase when they started to spread .
screv_place_root_tree	i set the bare root tree on the cone i left in the center of the hole
screv_place_root_tree	and spread out its roots over the cone .
screv_place_root_tree	i arranged the roots so the tree would be level ,
relnscrev_tree	no roots would be exposed , and the upper bark would n't be buried .
screv_refill_hole_tree	then i nearly filled the hole with soil ,
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	firming it lightly by patting it as i went .
unrelev_tree	when the hole was almost full ,
screv_water_tree	i watered slowly ,
relnscrev_tree	holding the tree straight
screv_water_tree	as the water soaked in .
screv_refill_hole_tree	then i filled up the hole completely .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	finally , i made a ring of soil around the tree ,
relnscrev_tree	to hold in water when the rainy season ended and i would have to irrigate .
relnscrev_tree	i used no fertilizer or amendments when i planted , because our sandy soil is fairly fertile , and i did n't want to make a dividing line that would encourage the tree to grow only in its tiny pothole of enriched soil .
relnscrev_tree	i wanted it to spread its roots , and it has .

evoking_tree	it 's spring time so i decided to plant a tree .
screv_get_tree_tree	i purchased a small orange tree to go in the back yard .
screv_dig_hole_tree	first i dug a hole
screv_find_place_tree	where i wanted the tree .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	then i shook the roots of the tree to loosen them .
screv_place_root_tree	then i placed the tree in the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i used a shovel to replace the dirt back over the tree roots .
screv_get_tools_tree	once satisfied the tree was firmly in the ground i dragged over the hose .
screv_water_tree	new trees needs lots of water .
screv_water_tree	i watered the tree until i was satisfied and then put mulch around the base .
screv_tie_stakes_up_tree	i also attached ropes to secure the young tree
relnscrev_tree	so it would n't fall over while it 's roots were still settling in .
relnscrev_tree	i also had a canval funnel installed to make sure water went right into the roots
relnscrev_tree	where it was need most .
unrelev_tree	once all was said and done i stepped back to admire my handy work .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	today i decided i wanted to do something special and plant a tree in my back yard .
relnscrev_tree	i went to the gardening supply store
relnscrev_tree	and bought everything i needed to make this happen .
screv_get_tree_tree	i purchased a shovel , some work gloves ,
screv_unwrap_root_tree	and a small potted tree .
screv_find_place_tree	when i got back home i quickly went to my backyard to find the perfect spot for the tree .
screv_find_place_tree	after picking out the spot ,
relnscrev_tree	i put on my new work gloves to protect my hands .
relnscrev_tree	then i got down on my knees ,
screv_get_tools_tree	grabbed the small shovel , and started digging a deep enough hole .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	when i was satisfied with the depth of the hole i removed the small tree from the pot
screv_place_root_tree	and placed it into the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i then covered up the hole with the dirt
relnscrev_tree	and made sure it was secure and safe .
screv_tie_stakes_up_tree	when i was finished securing it ,
screv_water_tree	i watered the surrounding area of the tree and admired my handy work .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	i did my research and made sure that whatever tree i was planting could survive in my region , since my state can get cold .
evoking_tree	i checked to make sure it was okay to plant the tree .
unrelev_tree	since my parents were the land-owners , they said yes .
screv_find_place_tree	i made sure to plant it far away from the house and any piper or wires .
relnscrev_tree	that way , when it grew larger , it would not be dangerous .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i decided to plant a pine tree .
unrelev_tree	they are not as messy in the fall , because they have needles that they keep instead of leaves that they shed .
screv_get_tree_tree	i bought a small sapling at a store .
relnscrev_tree	growing a tree from a seed is more difficult .
relnscrev_tree	i dug a hole in the ground wide enough to hold the roots well and about 23 inches deep .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	i gently removed the tree from its container
screv_place_root_tree	and placed it into the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	then , i covered the hole back up with soil
screv_water_tree	and watered the tree .
<end_of_story>
screv_find_place_tree	once you have located an area where you want to plant your tree ,
screv_get_tools_tree	you will need a shovel to begin digging a nice sized hole in the ground .
unrelev_tree	this will require some effort depending on how big your tree already is as the bigger the tree , the bigger and deeper the hole will need to be .
screv_dig_hole_tree	after digging the hole ,
relnscrev_tree	pull the tree out of the container that the tree is currently sitting in ,
screv_place_root_tree	and then place the tree into the hole .
screv_dig_hole_tree	if the dirt that was removed looks fertile ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	then you can push the dirt back into the hole to fill it back up .
unrelev_tree	if the dirt looks dry ,
screv_get_tools_tree	you may get a bag of potting soil
screv_refill_hole_tree	and pour that into the remaining area of the hole .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	good soil will ensure that your plant -lrb- especially if the plant is young -rrb- to have all the proper nutrition and environment to begin growing .
screv_water_tree	lastly , water the area where the plant is and you 're done .

unrelev_tree	earth day happens every year on april 23 .
evoking_tree	i decided to do something about it later year and went out to plant a tree this year .
relnscrev_tree	i wondered over to a local tree farm ,
screv_get_tree_tree	and bought a sapling with a friend .
unrelev_tree	we both borrowed a friend 's pick up truck
screv_take_home_tree	and drove to a place in the woods that we usually hang out at .
relnscrev_tree	while we arrived there , it was beautiful weather for the beginning of spring .
relnscrev_tree	we went off to the area where we always set up our tents when we go camping .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we ended up digging near the campsite
screv_unwrap_root_tree	and removed the bag around the sapling .
screv_place_root_tree	carefully , we both picked up the tree and placed it in the hole we dug and it fit in perfectly !
relnscrev_tree	after that i carefully held the tree in place
screv_refill_hole_tree	while my friend filled the hole back with dirt .
relnscrev_tree	a year later , the tree is still growing in perfect health .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	i decided one day to plant a tree in my front yard .
evoking_tree	i was unsure of what sort of tree i should plant so i went online and did research as to which type of tree would be best for my situation .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i settled on a magnificent norway pine , as it is common in northern minnesota .
relnscrev_tree	i went out to my nearest greenhouse , which i found via google maps ,
relnscrev_tree	and asked them where they kept their saplings -lrb- as i had read that this is how one should plant a tree -rrb- .
screv_take_home_tree	i got the sapling and brought it home with me .
relnscrev_tree	it was only six inches high but i knew i could make it grow tall and strong .
screv_get_tools_tree	i grabbed a shovel and started to dig , one small hole the size of the pot the sapling was in .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	i carefully took the sapling out of the pot
screv_dig_hole_tree	and placed it into the freshly dug hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	filling in the empty parts of the hole with extra dirt , i marveled at my creation .
evoking_tree	that was the day i planted a tree in my front yard .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	yesterday i planted a tree .
relnscrev_tree	first i went to a nursery .
unrelev_tree	a nursery is a place where they have , flowers , plants , shrubs and trees .
screv_get_tree_tree	i chose a sapling - a young tree - paid for it and put in in the back of my pickup truck .
screv_get_tools_tree	when i got home i got a shovel out of my shed
screv_dig_hole_tree	and dug a hole
relnscrev_tree	where i wanted to tree to grow ,
screv_find_place_tree	making sure it was n't too near my house .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i dug the hole about two feet deep , a little bigger than the root ball on the bottom of my tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	once i had the hole dug ,
screv_place_root_tree	i dropped the tree in ,
relnscrev_tree	making sure the trunk was straight .
relnscrev_tree	i cut the burlap surrounding the root ball ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	and then filled in the space around the tree with the dirt i had dug out earlier .
screv_get_tools_tree	finally , i grabbed a garden hose
screv_water_tree	and watered the tree , making sure to give it a good soaking .
unrelev_tree	the tree should give us pleasure for years to come .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	planting a tree is an important activity for most of us .
unrelev_tree	we need trees to survive ,
relnscrev_tree	and we need to replace the ones that are being cut down .
unrelev_tree	to do this , the right tools and location are necessary .
screv_get_tree_tree	i would begin by getting the striplings from a local nursery , as well as the right mulch and shovel .
screv_find_place_tree	next i would find the right spot , somewhere with plenty of shade and also sunlight ,
relnscrev_tree	where the roots can grow and not destroy a sidewalk or driveway .
screv_dig_hole_tree	with the right location in mind , i would dig down pretty deep ,
relnscrev_tree	deep enough that it wo n't topple out or be dug out by passing dogs or anything .
screv_dig_hole_tree	once the hole is dug ,
screv_place_root_tree	i can plant the stripling ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	fill the remainder of the hole with mulch
relnscrev_tree	and dirt and then attach some type of thin but sturdy pole or stick next to the baby tree so that it will have something supporting it until it grows strong and tall .

unrelev_tree	my husband and i love trees .
screv_get_tree_tree	in the spring we bought some trees from a catalog and planted them in may .
unrelev_tree	it was a nice warm day and the sun was shining .
unrelev_tree	it was n't too hot because there was a cool breeze .
relnscrev_tree	we went out to the back garden with shovels and trowels , gardening gloves and the hose .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we each dug a hole .
screv_choose_tree_tree	mine was for the white birch i had picked out , and my husband 's was for a hazel tree he had picked out .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we laughed and talked as we worked , and the digging went quickly .
unrelev_tree	the soil was also not too stony , which helped us greatly .
screv_place_root_tree	soon we had our trees in the holes ,
relnscrev_tree	and held them upright
screv_refill_hole_tree	as we scooped the dirt back into the holes with our trowels .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	we patted the dirt down ,
relnscrev_tree	made sure the trees were upright ,
relnscrev_tree	and gave them some water to grow on .
unrelev_tree	soon we would have two beautiful trees .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	it was arbor day and because of the occasion i decided to plant a tree in my backyard .
relnscrev_tree	i figured it would help the environment as well as be an oxygen source and in a few years i could maybe cut it down for firewood .
relnscrev_tree	i decided to go down to my local home depot
screv_get_tree_tree	and buy tree seeds and a shovel .
screv_take_home_tree	i then went back to my house and started uprooting the earth , creating a nice hole of dirt in which to plant my new tree .
screv_get_tree_tree	i got the tree seed
screv_place_root_tree	and planted it into the dirt
screv_refill_hole_tree	and covered it into the ground .
unrelev_tree	the good thing about trees are they are low maintenance and pretty self sufficient unlike other plants or flowers .
screv_water_tree	i still watered it every day to get it going and in a few years i will have a large majestic oak tree to provide shade and a new home for birds and other wildlife .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	last year i moved into a new house with my husband and my son .
relnscrev_tree	we decided that we wanted to start a garden .
evoking_tree	we planted flowers and vegetables , and we decided we would add a tree next to the garden .
unrelev_tree	we knew that the tree would be a nice addition to the garden .
relnscrev_tree	since i was unfamiliar with planting trees , i decided to look up different types of trees i could plant .
relnscrev_tree	i wanted to plant a tree that would grow well in our local climate .
relnscrev_tree	i went to the home
screv_choose_tree_tree	and garden store to look at different trees .
screv_choose_tree_tree	a salesperson helped me pick out a tree .
screv_place_root_tree	i took it home and planted it according to the instructions .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	i made sure the soil was packed firmly at the base of the tree .
unrelev_tree	now that a year has passed ,
relnscrev_tree	the tree has grown quite a bit .
unrelev_tree	it is a nice plant that we all enjoy .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	on arbor day of 23 , i planted a tree .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i chose a hardy colorado blue spruce evergreen tree from arborday.org .
relnscrev_tree	this website makes learning about planting trees easy .
relnscrev_tree	i could have chosen to wait to plant my tree because they come in tiny plastic tubes that can be stored in the refrigerator for when i am ready .
relnscrev_tree	the colorado blue spruce grows well in my area of the united states .
relnscrev_tree	i 'm not a tree expert so i wanted a tree that would not need a lot of skill to plant .
unrelev_tree	it will be many ,
relnscrev_tree	many years before my tree becomes a tall and magnificent giant but i know i did something good for our earth by planting it .
evoking_tree	i am going to plant a tree every year for arbor day because i loved how easy it was .
unrelev_tree	it has only been a year
relnscrev_tree	but my little tree is growing out of the ground and i have n't had to do anything to tend to it .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	earth day is a very important day in america .
unrelev_tree	it is a day where we recognize the environment and the fact that we need to protect it .
evoking_tree	this earth day my friend patrick and i decided that we should plant a tree to counteract the effects of deforesting .
screv_dig_hole_tree	to do this we first dug a hole in the ground twice the size of the root ball of the tree .
relnscrev_tree	it was hard work , but it ensures that the tree has enough loose soil to spread its roots in .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we then placed the tree in the middle of the pit we had dug and made sure it was centered .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	after that we filled in the rest of the pit with a high quality planting soil in order to give the tree proper nutrition .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	after the soil was placed in we stepped on the soil to compact it and make sure the tree stays in place .
unrelev_tree	it felt really good to give back to the environment instead of damaging it .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_tree	last summer , my friend heidi and i were walking through home depot when we saw tree seedlings for sale .
screv_get_tree_tree	we had been looking for a new project to do together , so we decided to purchase one . .
screv_get_tree_tree	after making the purchase ,
screv_find_place_tree	we went looking for a place to plant our tree .
screv_find_place_tree	we agreed on her backyard , since my house does not have much of a yard .
screv_take_home_tree	when we got to her house ,
screv_find_place_tree	we found a perfect place in the corner of her backyard .
screv_get_tools_tree	we grabbed our shovels and began to roughen the sides and bottom of where we were planting a tree ,
relnscrev_tree	so that the root tips can penetrate the soil .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	then we created a water basin with mulch
screv_water_tree	and filled the basin with water .
evoking_tree	we were proud of our newly planted tree , so we made sure to take many pictures .
relnscrev_tree	we ca n't wait to see how our tree will grow over the years .

unrelev_tree	in the morning , i woke up to prepare for the day .
unrelev_tree	after getting coffee ready , i took on breakfast .
unrelev_tree	my partner awoke , and she began to get ready in the bathroom .
unrelev_tree	she was out by the time food was ready .
unrelev_tree	we spoke about our plans for the day , and what we intended our goals to be .
unrelev_tree	after getting dressed up to head outside ,
screv_choose_tree_tree	we headed over to the gardening store to choose a tree for our yard .
screv_choose_tree_tree	both of us were hoping for a nice japanese maple tree .
unrelev_tree	the checkout lady was nice ,
relnscrev_tree	we found exactly what we were looking for after we got into the store .
screv_take_home_tree	driving home , we could barely contain our excitement .
unrelev_tree	after stepping back in the house for a quick snack and another cup of coffee ,
screv_get_tools_tree	we set out to the shed to get the right tools .
screv_dig_hole_tree	the hole was easy to dig , and the tree was transplanted successfully .
<end_of_story>
screv_choose_tree_tree	i travel to the local nursery to select a tree for planting , today i have decided to purchase a flowering maple tree .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i ensure the one i pick is high quality with no rotting and looks healthy .
screv_find_place_tree	once in my yard i determine the best location based on the expected height it will grow and other plants in the yard .
screv_dig_hole_tree	with my garden shovel i dig a hole at least twice the size of the roots of the tree .
relnscrev_tree	i ensure rocks and are removed from the hole .
relnscrev_tree	i put plenty of organic matter in the hole to ensure good growth .
screv_place_root_tree	i gently place the tree in the hole
screv_dig_hole_tree	and refill with the shoveled dirt .
screv_get_tools_tree	i place my garden hose at the base of the tree
screv_water_tree	and turn the water to a very slow stream
relnscrev_tree	so it will absorb into the soil properly .
screv_water_tree	i allow the water to run for about and hour ensuring it does n't get soggy .
unrelev_tree	i step back and admire my new tree and envision what it will look like a year from now .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	a few years ago , i did some volunteer work in my local community .
unrelev_tree	i like giving back to my community .
evoking_tree	one of the things we did was plant trees in the city .
evoking_tree	this was my first experience with planting trees .
screv_dig_hole_tree	first i had to prepare the ground .
unrelev_tree	the soil was already in great shape for the tree so that part was taken care of .
screv_get_tools_tree	i grabbed a shovel and then started digging .
screv_place_root_tree	then it was time to plan the tree .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	the tree was small , so i was able to remove it from the pot by putting it upside down .
screv_place_root_tree	i then gently placed the tree in the hole
screv_refill_hole_tree	and then filled the hole back up with the dirt .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	the next thing i did was add mulch around the area of the tree .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	once the mulch was added ,
screv_tie_stakes_up_tree	i put a stake in the ground and tied it to the tree .
relnscrev_tree	this was to hold the tree in place as it grows for the first year .

unrelev_tree	it 's spring !
unrelev_tree	after a long and dreary winter , most of us are ready to see green plants , blooming flowers , and a clean cut green lawn in our yards .
evoking_tree	springtime is also an opportunity to freshen up our yards with new plants .
relnscrev_tree	taking this into consideration , i decided to make a trip to my local lawn and garden shop .
unrelev_tree	as expected the shop had tons of blooming pot flowers .
unrelev_tree	i could n't help but pick at least one .
screv_get_tree_tree	i was tempted to even buy a fruit plant , but decided to save my money and buy that another time .
screv_choose_tree_tree	what particularly took my interest was a young oak sapling that was hiding in the back behind all the potted flowers .
unrelev_tree	i did n't have any oak trees in my yard , and to be honest neither did anyone in my neighborhood .
unclear_tree	i thought it would be a fantastic idea to introduce this tree to my front yard .
screv_get_tree_tree	so i paid the $ 23 for the young sapling and prepared to plant it next to my driveway .
unrelev_tree	to begin ,
screv_get_tools_tree	i found a small shovel from my garage
screv_dig_hole_tree	and dug out a 23 foot diameter and 23 foot deep circular hole .
relnscrev_tree	i picked out any rocks that were remaining in the hole ,
relnscrev_tree	removed any surrounding weeds .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	then i removed the tree from its temporary pot
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	and put it and the nutrient-filled soil it came in into the hole i dug out .
screv_refill_hole_tree	then filled the rest of the hole with dirt ,
screv_water_tree	gave the plant a little water , and waited for it to grow into a big healthy tree .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	in the midst of a great and cold winter , the color and feel of the surrounding enviornment had become depressing and lacking of color or warmth .
unrelev_tree	as the days rolled by and the temperature flirted with hospitable warmth i planned the beginnings of a new spring garden .
unrelev_tree	one of the new additions would be a fruit tree .
unrelev_tree	given the climate here in the south we are blessed with an ability to have both cold and warm types of trees to a certain degree .
screv_choose_tree_tree	this would be a cold tolerant tree .
relnscrev_tree	i took an apple from some time ago that i had chilled seeds in the freezer for .
relnscrev_tree	the chilling of the seeds are supposed to mimick natural coldness and bring forth the seed easier .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	i then prepared the soil with fertilizer in a pot
screv_place_root_tree	and planted the seed .
unrelev_tree	the tree took off slowly as a sprout and a few years later has about 23 or 23 feet in height .
<end_of_story>
screv_choose_tree_tree	my husband always wanted a lemon tree because he loves lemons .
unclear_tree	for his birthday we surprised him with one .
relnscrev_tree	we went to the nursery
screv_get_tree_tree	and bought the tree .
relnscrev_tree	we got it into the back of the truck
screv_take_home_tree	and drove home .
relnscrev_tree	we got the tree into the back yard and he was very surprised .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we all pitched in and dug up a big circle of grass in the back yard .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we dug a big hole
screv_place_root_tree	and put the tree in it .
screv_get_tools_tree	using shovels we filled it in with some good purchased dirt that the nursery recommended .
screv_get_tools_tree	we got a bunch of bricks that were laying around against the fence
screv_tie_stakes_up_tree	and lined the bricks all around it .
unrelev_tree	it 's been a year now and he has quite a few big green lemons .
unrelev_tree	he ate one the other day even though it was n't ripe .
unrelev_tree	he said it was good .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	our back yard was so bare , so we decided to plant a tree to spruce it up .
screv_choose_tree_tree	we decided a nice apple tree would look great , and give us fresh fruit
relnscrev_tree	when it 's grown .
relnscrev_tree	first we went to the nursery
screv_get_tree_tree	and bough an apple tree sapling .
screv_take_home_tree	then when we got home , we got to work .
screv_place_root_tree	we dug a hole in the ground big enough for the sapling to be planted .
unrelev_tree	once we had the hole ready ,
screv_place_root_tree	in went the sapling .
screv_place_root_tree	we made sure it was in deep enough
relnscrev_tree	and was standing straight up ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	then we put the dirt back in around the sapling .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	we carefully patted the dirt down
relnscrev_tree	so it would hold the sapling nice and firm .
unrelev_tree	once we had done that ,
screv_get_tools_tree	we took the garden hose
screv_water_tree	and watered our new plant , making sure it had enough water ,
relnscrev_tree	but not so much that the dirt would get too muddy and the sapling might be loose .
unrelev_tree	then we took a step back and looked at what would eventually become our new apple tree .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	last year we had a fire .
unrelev_tree	a large fire , that burned down homes and trees .
unrelev_tree	i felt lucky that my home had survived , but the trees nearby had not .
screv_take_home_tree	i had just returned from a trip to the nursery
screv_choose_tree_tree	where i had picked out a couple of small fruit bearing saplings .
unrelev_tree	one was cherry , the other was plum .
relnscrev_tree	now they sit next to the car , along with a shovel .
screv_dig_hole_tree	after some consideration , i pulled on my gloves and stepped out into the now barren area next to my house to dig two holes , approximately 23 feet apart .
relnscrev_tree	i wanted to give them room to grow , yet close enough to have company .
unrelev_tree	this thought amused me .
screv_place_root_tree	i places each sapling into its hole ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	patting new earth around it in a mound .
screv_water_tree	the i turned on the water hose , and gave them a good drink ,
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	tapping down the new earth with the shovel .
unrelev_tree	'' `` welcome home '' '' i thought , as i smiled .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	planting a tree is a very difficult task .
relnscrev_tree	first , i went to walmart or another nursery in the area
screv_choose_tree_tree	and pick a tree .
relnscrev_tree	when i get to walmart ,
screv_choose_tree_tree	i asked the cashier for which trees are easiest to take care because i can not take care of plants very well .
screv_choose_tree_tree	then i figured out whether i want a tree for the sun or shade .
screv_choose_tree_tree	when i picked a tree ,
screv_get_tree_tree	i took it to the cashier and paid for it .
screv_take_home_tree	then i put the tree in the back of my car and went home .
screv_take_home_tree	next , when i got home ,
relnscrev_tree	i took the tree outside
screv_place_root_tree	and figured out where i wouldput it in the yard .
screv_dig_hole_tree	afterwards , i dug a whole
screv_place_root_tree	where the tree would go .
unrelev_tree	the hole was the size of the pot of the tree .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	then i pulled the tree out of the pot
screv_dig_hole_tree	and put the whole thing in the hole i dug .
screv_refill_hole_tree	then , i covered the sides with more dirt
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	and put some fertilizer
relnscrev_tree	and water around the tree so it set in the ground .

unrelev_tree	when i was a child my elementary school got a grant .
unrelev_tree	-lrb- actually i think it may have been a grant given to the entire school district -rrb- .
evoking_tree	the grant was for putting in new shade trees at the school .
unrelev_tree	of course i was in fourth grade , so i was never really able to benefit from the new tree , as it probably took five to 23 years to produce any real shade .
unrelev_tree	the school made a big deal about the new trees , i think there were 23 of them .
screv_find_place_tree	the principal -lrb- and probably many other adults -rrb- met to decide where to put the trees .
evoking_tree	then there was a contest to see which classes got to plant them .
screv_dig_hole_tree	my class ` won ' the chance and all of us in the class got to take a scoop of dirt out , it was of course a mess .
relnscrev_tree	then a landscaper came ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	quickly fixed the hole ,
screv_place_root_tree	set the tree in and let all of the kids who wanted to put the dirt back around the tree by hand .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	it was messy work and he constantly told us not to push down on the dirt .
relnscrev_tree	then he put in 23 stakes to hold the tree up
screv_water_tree	and we watered it .
unrelev_tree	i being a child , promptly forgot the tree and did not think about it again for years , but when i went back to the school as a teenager -lrb- to play on the swings -rrb- i remembered and was surprised how big it was .
unrelev_tree	because the tree was out in a large open play area it was great that it provided a lot of shade for the children at recess .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	one day i decided that my backyard was missing something .
unrelev_tree	i walked around in my backyard and decided that a tree would go perfectly in the corner .
relnscrev_tree	i drove to my local plant store and walked around looking at all the various trees .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i read the tags and found one that would do perfect in my climate and it looked very cool .
relnscrev_tree	i walked up to the worker and told them i would like to purchase the tree .
screv_get_tree_tree	they loaded the tree up and i paid for the tree
screv_take_home_tree	and drove home .
relnscrev_tree	i brought the tree into the backyard and set it down .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i took out my shovel and dug a large enough hole for the tree .
screv_place_root_tree	i placed the tree in the hole
screv_refill_hole_tree	and filled it in with dirt .
screv_water_tree	then i took my hose and watered the tree in place .
unrelev_tree	i took a step back and marveled at how wonderful my new tree looked .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	'' `` planting a tree '' '' jenny and her grandpa decided that early spring was a wonderful time to plant a new tree in the front yard .
evoking_tree	'' '' what kind of tree will we plant grandpa ?
unrelev_tree	'' '' jenny asked .
unrelev_tree	grandpa scratched his head .
unrelev_tree	'' '' hmmmm i do n't know jenny '' '' he replied .
relnscrev_tree	'' `` we need to decide what we will want the tree for .
unrelev_tree	'' '' jenny tilted her small head and asked '' `` what do you mean grandpa ?
unrelev_tree	what can trees do ?
unrelev_tree	'' '' trees can do many things , provide shade , flowers or food just to name a few . things .
screv_choose_tree_tree	'' '' they decided to take a ride to a plant nursery to look at all the small young trees .
screv_choose_tree_tree	grandpa did not want the pine tree .
unrelev_tree	even though it would stay green all year .
screv_choose_tree_tree	he did not want the lilac tree even though the flowers would smell so pretty in each spring .
screv_choose_tree_tree	instead he picked a nice sized apple tree .
unrelev_tree	jenny bounced with excitement .
unrelev_tree	'' `` grandpa we can pick apples soon ?
unrelev_tree	'' '' she exclaimed .
unrelev_tree	'' `` someday he said smiling down at her .
screv_get_tree_tree	grandpa brought the tree to the cashier and paid the fee for their tree
screv_take_home_tree	and carefully loaded it into the back of his truck .
relnscrev_tree	at home grandpa got the tools they would need from his little gardening shed .
relnscrev_tree	a hose , watering can , shovel , two pairs of gardening gloves and a tiny shovel just right for jenny 's helping hands .
screv_get_tree_tree	after putting on their gardening gloves together they dug a hole five times larger than the root ball of the tree they had paid for at the nursery .
relnscrev_tree	grandpa gently turned the small tree upside down to remove it from the pot it had been growing in .
screv_place_root_tree	he told jenny it was important to now plant the small tree right away
relnscrev_tree	so it 's tender rooms did not dry out .
relnscrev_tree	he placed the roots into the hole they has dug and made sure the top of the root ball was level with the ground
relnscrev_tree	and that they tree was standing straight and tall .
screv_refill_hole_tree	together they filled in the rest of the hole around the trees roots .
screv_water_tree	jenny helped grandpa filled the watering can with water from the hose
screv_water_tree	and she watched proudly as grandpa watered their newly planted apple tree .
unrelev_tree	jenny was full of pride watching the small young trees leave blowing in the cool early spring breeze .

evoking_tree	yesterday , i noticed my yard did not have any shade , so i decided to plant a tree .
relnscrev_tree	first , i went to the garden store
screv_get_tree_tree	and bought a sapling ; a baby tree .
screv_take_home_tree	i took the sapling home
screv_find_place_tree	and surveyed my yard for the best place to plant it .
screv_find_place_tree	i choose a sunny spot right in the middle of my backyard .
screv_find_place_tree	i then took a shovel and dug into the earth at the spot i decided on .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i dug a little hole in that area .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	i unwrapped the root of the sapling
screv_dig_hole_tree	and placed it in the small hole that i had dug .
screv_refill_hole_tree	then i used a spade to fill in the dirt around the tree root , so that the roots were totally covered by dirt .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	i added a little fertilizer in the dirt around the roots
relnscrev_tree	so that the tree would grow big and strong .
relnscrev_tree	i stepped back and looked at my new tree and was so happy that the task was accomplished .
relnscrev_tree	one day that sapling will grow into a large tree and provide shade to my backyard .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	my backyard was looking a little empty , so i decided i would plant something in it .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i decided on a tree .
screv_get_tree_tree	i went out and bought some tree seeds .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i picked a species that i thought would grow well in the sun since my back yard receives a lot of sunlight .
screv_take_home_tree	once i was back home ,
screv_get_tools_tree	i brought out all my gardening tools .
screv_get_tools_tree	i found a shovel and a watering can .
screv_find_place_tree	with my seeds and tools , i found a spot in my yard that looked like it would get enough sunshine .
screv_dig_hole_tree	there , i dug a hole for the seeds .
screv_place_root_tree	i put a few in ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	and covered dirt back on top .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	after that i patted the the mound of earth back down .
unrelev_tree	once that was done ,
screv_get_tools_tree	i took my watering can
screv_water_tree	and watered the seeds until the soil was fairly moist .
screv_other_tree_tree	after that , i went to put away gardening supplies .
screv_water_tree	i planned to water my tree periodically .
screv_water_tree	i knew that if i took good care of it ,
relnscrev_tree	it would grow up to be a full-sized tree .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	a the church summer camp i volunteer at it was decided that we should try to make the campus more sustainable as well as beautiful .
evoking_tree	planting fruit bearing trees was thought to be a good way to achieve these goals as well as letting the participants learn more about where food sources come from .
relnscrev_tree	research was done into finding trees that would bear fruit in the season that the camp was most used .
relnscrev_tree	as well as having the requirements of water and sunlight and soil work with the land at camp .
screv_get_tree_tree	several trees were ordered , including a cherry tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	in the chosen location a hole was dug and the tree had the burlap removed from the root ball
screv_place_root_tree	and it was placed in at the appropriate depth .
screv_refill_hole_tree	the soil with a few amendments was replaced and grass seed was sprinkled on .
screv_water_tree	the tree was watered as suggested and i was assigned to schedule future watering and monitor the tree for health and insect invasions .
<end_of_story>
screv_find_place_tree	first , you need to pick out where you want to put your tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	you 're going to be digging quite a large hole ,
relnscrev_tree	so you need to consider a few things .
relnscrev_tree	first of all , make sure you place your tree where it wo n't mess anything up
relnscrev_tree	as it grows .
relnscrev_tree	you want to put it somewhere where it has plenty of room to grow , with soft dirt .
relnscrev_tree	next , you need to gather the tree you 're going to plant as well as a shovel .
screv_dig_hole_tree	then you 're going to dig a nice big hole .
unrelev_tree	you want the entire roots of the tree to be covered sufficiently in dirt , so make sure it 's plenty big enough .
screv_place_root_tree	next , you place your tree in it 's hole .
screv_other_tree_tree	position it properly .
unrelev_tree	make sure it 's got plenty of room .
screv_refill_hole_tree	finally , you can fill in dirt around your tree .
relnscrev_tree	now you 're finished and you can watch your tree grow !
relnscrev_tree	soon you 'll have a nice big tree to shade you !

unrelev_tree	my neighborhood is kind of boring looking since there are n't many plants , i guess you could say it looks barren .
unrelev_tree	one day i decided to do something about this ,
relnscrev_tree	so i went to the local plant store with the intention of buying a tree .
unrelev_tree	i decided i wanted the tree to be functional rather than just cosmetic ,
screv_get_tree_tree	so i decided to buy a small apple tree .
screv_take_home_tree	i brought the tree home and got to work digging a hole in my front yard with a shovel .
unrelev_tree	it was hard work and the weather was hot ,
relnscrev_tree	but finally the hole was big enough to plant the tree .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	i then carefully took the tree out of its pot
screv_place_root_tree	and placed it in the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i filled the hole back up with dirt
relnscrev_tree	and made sure the tree was steady .
unrelev_tree	it was a nice sight , some of my neighbors even complimented me .
screv_water_tree	i now water the tree every day to make sure it grows strong .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	i decided my backyard needed another tree .
screv_get_tree_tree	so i went to the tree nursery
screv_choose_tree_tree	and picked out a tree that i liked .
relnscrev_tree	i rented a pickup truck to bring the tree home .
relnscrev_tree	i loaded the tree into the truck and drove it to my house .
screv_get_tools_tree	i grabbed a shovel from my garage ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	and i dug a hole in my backyard where i wanted the tree to go .
relnscrev_tree	i poured some special tree fertilizer into the hole that i had bought from the tree nursery .
relnscrev_tree	i then asked a friend to help me , because the tree was very big and heavy .
screv_place_root_tree	together we placed the tree in the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i then started to fill up the dirt around the tree .
screv_refill_hole_tree	halfway through filling it ,
relnscrev_tree	i took a garden hose
screv_water_tree	and poured water down the hole .
relnscrev_tree	when the water settled , i finished filling in the dirt .
screv_other_tree_tree	over the dirt i placed a nice bed of mulch around the tree .
screv_water_tree	i watered the tree once more , then stepped back to admire my work .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_tree	i visited a big garden nursery store
screv_choose_tree_tree	and picked out a tree to plant in my garden .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i wanted to pick out a tree that was a good size for my garden space .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i picked out a tree that was green and healthy .
unrelev_tree	the tree was n't too big
screv_take_home_tree	so i brought it home in a pot .
screv_get_tools_tree	i also bought a shovel and a bag of potting soil .
relnscrev_tree	in my garden at home , i began digging a hole in the soil with my shovel to fit my tree .
relnscrev_tree	i picked a spot to plant it where i think it would get the most exposure to sunlight to grow .
relnscrev_tree	i planted the tree in the hole
relnscrev_tree	and then shoveled the fresh new soil into the hole to hold the tree up .
relnscrev_tree	the fresh new soil will be good for the tree to grow instead of using the old soil .
screv_water_tree	i watered the tree
relnscrev_tree	and soil and now i will wait for it to flourish in my garden .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	when i was very young , my family only just recently got our new home .
unrelev_tree	the backyard had no trees and little decoration but that soon changed over the years .
evoking_tree	about a year after we moved in , my dad decided it was time we planted a tree in the backyard
relnscrev_tree	and i was able to help .
unrelev_tree	i had no idea what type of tree it would be and when i asked my dad just said i 'd have to wait and find out .
unrelev_tree	i would n't know it but several years later the tree would be larger than the house itself .
unrelev_tree	to get things started ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	i dug up a small hole to plant the tree .
relnscrev_tree	my dad had to make sure the hole was just the right size .
relnscrev_tree	once the space was perfect ,
screv_place_root_tree	i carefully placed the very young tree into it 's new home
screv_refill_hole_tree	and covered the roots up with dirt .
relnscrev_tree	after it was firmly set in place ,
screv_water_tree	i watered the tree and was done for the day .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	it was in last spring , when we were taking photos by standing in front of our house , we felt like our photos lacked something .
unrelev_tree	later we reached a conclusion that we do n't have enough green around our house .
evoking_tree	so we thought it would be nice if we plant a tree in our yard .
unrelev_tree	so we started our search on trees .
unrelev_tree	during summer time a lot of rabbits come to our house and destroy all plants .
unrelev_tree	therefore we are in need of a plant that should n't attract rabbits .
relnscrev_tree	we read reviews of different types of trees .
screv_choose_tree_tree	at last we reached a conclusion to buy a maple tree so that we can enjoy fall too .
evoking_tree	we were new to planting a tree ,
relnscrev_tree	so we watched some videos to get some information .
relnscrev_tree	in one website they suggested to plant a somewhat tall plant rather than a small plant .
screv_get_tree_tree	so we went to home depot bought a plant and a shovel .
unrelev_tree	it was a very beautiful maple tree .
relnscrev_tree	after reaching home i dug a pit just to fit the plant base which was packed with some soil .
screv_other_tree_tree	me and my wife held it and kept the plant in to the pit
relnscrev_tree	and removed the plastic sheets which wrapped the plant base together with the soil .
screv_refill_hole_tree	after that we poured the soil back to the pit and made the plant to stand straight .
unrelev_tree	it was a please experience .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	today i planted a tree .
screv_get_tree_tree	i used a small evergreen tree that i had purchased from a mail order company a few weeks before .
screv_other_tree_tree	since it arrived just the day before ,
relnscrev_tree	i had to plant it today , before it died .
screv_get_tools_tree	first i gathered up all the things i would need .
screv_get_tools_tree	i got my gloves , my shovel , my small trowel and my gardening apron , as well as some potting soil i had bought from the store earlier in the week .
screv_find_place_tree	i carried all this to the spot i had picked out for my new tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	the first thing i did when i arrived at my spot was to take my shovel and dig a hole that was 23 inches deep .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	next , i took the tree and removed that burlap sack that encased the roots ,
screv_place_root_tree	and placed the tree in the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i then used my small trowel to fill in the hole with the potting soil .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	after i was done i used the large shovel to tamp the dirt down around the tree ,
relnscrev_tree	to pack it tight so the tree would n't fall over .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	now that winter is over ,
relnscrev_tree	our planting season has begun .
screv_get_tree_tree	last weekend , i went out and bought a small apple tree .
screv_find_place_tree	i found a perfect spot in my back yard for it .
relnscrev_tree	first i looked around and decided even if it grew very large , it would n't run into any other trees or power lines .
relnscrev_tree	next i got to work with my tiller ,
screv_other_tree_tree	cutting into the earth and churning up the dirt .
unrelev_tree	once everything was loosened ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	i took my shovel and dig a hole .
screv_place_root_tree	i gently placed the small young tree into that spot ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	burying it 's roots in the hole i had dug .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	i added some coffee grounds to the soil around the roots ,
relnscrev_tree	and then took my shovel and got to work covering the roots up again .
relnscrev_tree	finally , i smoothed the dirt with my shovel and went to get my garden hose .
relnscrev_tree	a new tree needs water !
screv_water_tree	i watered the ground beneath ot .
relnscrev_tree	smiling , i admired the small but sturdy tree in my yard that will someday be a large tree that gives us fruit .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	my family moved into a new house and we wanted to plant a year to celebrate our new beginning .
relnscrev_tree	we knew that the tree would grow over the years and would be a great reminder of how long we had lived there .
screv_find_place_tree	we chose a spot in our yard where the tree would have plenty of space to grow .
screv_get_tools_tree	my dad brought out some shovels
screv_dig_hole_tree	and we all helped to dig a big hole .
unrelev_tree	the tree was not very large yet , but the ball of roots at the bottom made it very heavy .
screv_other_tree_tree	we all helped dad lift the tree and carry it over to the hole .
screv_place_root_tree	we placed it in gently , being very careful not to damage the roots or the branches .
relnscrev_tree	we threw some fertilizer into the hole to feed the tree and then we started to refill the hole with the dirt we had dug out .
unrelev_tree	we made sure the tree was nice
relnscrev_tree	and straight and standing tall
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	and then began patting down the dirt .
relnscrev_tree	when it was finished we turned on the hose
screv_water_tree	and gave it plenty of water .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	a few blocks from my home they are putting in a small park and playground for the children in the neighborhood .
evoking_tree	the community has raised money to purchase playground equipment and plant some trees in the park .
evoking_tree	the playground is nearly complete and all the is left to do is some landscaping and get the trees planted .
relnscrev_tree	the trees arrived with their roots all covered in burlap , the roots of these small trees are actually quite large .
screv_get_tools_tree	the city has loaned us a small backhoe
relnscrev_tree	so we can dig the appropriate sized holes for the new trees and help move them into position .
screv_dig_hole_tree	the operator has dug dole that 's about twice the size of the root ball and it takes about three people to hold and steady the tree in the hole
relnscrev_tree	as they fill in each one using the backhoe .
relnscrev_tree	we plant about 23 trees in one afternoon .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	as the sun starts to set we have planted water and fertilized all the trees for the park .
unrelev_tree	the trees are beautiful
relnscrev_tree	and in a few years will provide shade to many areas of the park .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	unfortunately my poor dog just passed away .
unrelev_tree	he was a good and loyal friend who never failed to alert me if someone came on my property .
unrelev_tree	as i was looking upon his poor stiffening body i could not find a way to say goodbye to such a great creature .
unrelev_tree	finally i decided to bury him in the front yard of the house he had so faithfully guarded for many , many years .
unrelev_tree	i went to the store
screv_get_tree_tree	and purchased a black cherry tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i dug a hole and placed his carefully and lovingly wrapped body in to the hole .
screv_place_root_tree	i then placed the cherry tree on top of where he lay for eternal rest
relnscrev_tree	and watered it and staked it and placed a small fence around it .
relnscrev_tree	now as the tree grows it will absorb my frind and in a sense he will always be there to watch over my home and the yard he loved to play in .
<end_of_story>
screv_get_tree_tree	i bought a tree from my local plant supply store .
unrelev_tree	it was a small sapling with only a few branches on it .
screv_get_tools_tree	i took a shovel out of my garage
screv_find_place_tree	and found a good place for the tree next to my house .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i began digging a hole with the shovel for a few minutes until the hole was about one and a half feet deep .
relnscrev_tree	i set down the shovel ,
screv_unwrap_root_tree	and removed the plastic wrap from the tree 's roots .
screv_other_tree_tree	i separated the roots and loosened them apart .
screv_place_root_tree	i set the tree down into the hole ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	and used the shovel to fill in the space around the roots with dirt and fertilizer that would help the tree grow better .
screv_get_tools_tree	then , i took a bag of mulch from out of the garage
relnscrev_tree	and spread some of it around the tree to help protect it from other invasive plants .
screv_water_tree	i watered the tree with a watering can .

evoking_tree	planting a tree to bring in spring a friend gave me a gift .
relnscrev_tree	she brought me a tree that i could plant in my own yard and enjoy for years to come .
unrelev_tree	it was a douglas fir evergreen tree .
unrelev_tree	spring had come a few weeks before and the temperatures were mild again .
evoking_tree	one sunny day , i decided to plant my tree .
relnscrev_tree	i planted my tree in my backyard .
screv_find_place_tree	it seemed to be the best place for it .
unrelev_tree	i looked forward to
relnscrev_tree	when the tree grew and provided shade and beauty to the landscape .
relnscrev_tree	i was so inspired by planting this tree that i decided that i wanted to plant a few more trees .
screv_other_tree_tree	i went to a local nursery
relnscrev_tree	and picked out three more varieties of trees that would grow well in my local area .
relnscrev_tree	i took them home and planted them as long .
relnscrev_tree	in a few years , my backyard will be even more beautiful than it is today due to the short amount of time that it took me to plant a few trees .

unrelev_tree	last fourth of july we had a nice family dinner outside .
unrelev_tree	unfortunately the sun was so hot and we had nothing to provide us shade .
evoking_tree	this year i wanted to do something different so i decided to plant a tree right where the table was outside .
unrelev_tree	maybe this year we would have some shade to keep us cool .
screv_other_tree_tree	i went to the local farmer ,
relnscrev_tree	farmer jack and asked him if he could help me out .
relnscrev_tree	he told me that i would want to grow a nice oak tree right by that table .
relnscrev_tree	he was able to give me some seeds to use so i could make my plan happen .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i used a small gardening tool to dig up some dirt .
screv_other_tree_tree	i placed the seeds inside the dirt and then covered it up again .
screv_get_tools_tree	i took a watering can
relnscrev_tree	and filled it up with water from the hose .
screv_water_tree	i watered the dirt where the seeds were and did this every day without fail .
relnscrev_tree	i 've started to see a tree sprouting and am excited for fourth of july to get here .

unrelev_tree	in a few weeks , places around the world will be celebrating earth day , a global event promoting environment protection .
unrelev_tree	i will , as i do every year , meet up with some friends who live close by and spend the day at the park .
unrelev_tree	we will have a picnic , eat some food and drink a few beers , play frisbee and toss around a football and at some point ,
evoking_tree	we will plant trees off to the side of the park .
relnscrev_tree	we will plant these trees in an effort to promote environmental sustainability , and to do our part as one in a millions ' chance to help the environment .
unrelev_tree	damage is being caused to the environment and local ecosystems at an alarming rate and we should all join together to do what we can in promoting awareness and getting the word out that we need to change our ways to help protect our environment .
evoking_tree	planting a tree is my small contribution .
<end_of_story>
screv_get_tree_tree	in the late spring , i bought a beautiful little tree from a nursery .
relnscrev_tree	the workers there helped me find a type of tree that would grow tall and give good shade in the summer .
screv_take_home_tree	when i went home ,
relnscrev_tree	i thought about the best place in my backyard to put the tree .
screv_water_tree	the tree 's roots were tied up in a little bag with some potting soil to give it water and nutrients for a little while ,
relnscrev_tree	but it had to be put in the ground soon to keep it healthy .
unrelev_tree	i went to my garden shed
screv_get_tools_tree	and got some tools
relnscrev_tree	so i could plant it as soon as possible .
screv_get_tools_tree	first i got a big wheelbarrow to help me carry everything i needed .
screv_other_tree_tree	in the wheelbarrow , i put the little tree , a shovel , a big watering can , and a garden rake .
relnscrev_tree	then i pushed it to the spot in my yard that i wanted to put the tree .
screv_other_tree_tree	i took the tree and all the tools out of the wheelbarrow , except for the shovel .
unrelev_tree	then i pushed my wheelbarrow to my compost bin at the other side of my garden .
screv_other_tree_tree	i one by one , i scooped a shovelful of compost into my wheelbarrow until there was enough to fill a couple of buckets .
relnscrev_tree	the compost would help the tree get a head start on growing tall and healthy .
screv_other_tree_tree	i pushed the wheelbarrow back to
relnscrev_tree	where i wanted to plant the tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	next , i had to dig a hole so the tree would be secure in the ground .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i stuck the tip of the shovel in the ground and pushed down hard on it with my foot .
unrelev_tree	the ground gave way ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	and i was able to scoop the dirt out of the way .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i did this until i had a round hole over two feet deep .
screv_place_root_tree	i put the tree in the hole ,
relnscrev_tree	but it would not stand up straight , and instead leaned on one side of the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i slowly scooped compost and dirt into the hole ,
relnscrev_tree	carefully adjusting the tree to stand upright again after each shovelful .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	i patted the earth down to keep it compact .
screv_refill_hole_tree	after a lot of hard work , the hole was finally filled with dirt and compost ,
relnscrev_tree	and the tree was standing upright and strong .
screv_other_tree_tree	i smoothed over the dirt and compost with my garden rake , then filled up the watering can with water from a hose .
relnscrev_tree	i slowly poured the water over the freshly raked dirt , letting the water soak into the ground .
relnscrev_tree	the tree was planted and ready to grow !
<end_of_story>
screv_other_tree_tree	first we began by going to the orchard
screv_choose_tree_tree	and picking the best tree we could find , this however did not satisfy the little ones
screv_choose_tree_tree	so we had to go with the tree that they picked out .
screv_take_home_tree	we drove back home with the tree on top of the car to begin the planting .
relnscrev_tree	starting off i dug a medium sized hole where we could plant the tree and it could grow as much as it wanted .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	we fertilized the ground
relnscrev_tree	where the tree would be planted and began the transfer of the tree .
screv_other_tree_tree	this tree was then checked daily on its progress
screv_water_tree	and to be watered .
unrelev_tree	the tree 's health was a priority of our family
relnscrev_tree	and we kept it in spectacular condition .
relnscrev_tree	this tree now stands tall over our house to protect it from the sun and allow us the shade we need when we would like to play outside .
unrelev_tree	this tree is the foundation of our family and we use it to show our togetherness .

evoking_tree	over the summer , my friend and i decided to plant a tree .
evoking_tree	we always wanted to plant one but we never had the time to do it .
evoking_tree	now we had the time and we were determined to plant the tree .
evoking_tree	we decided to plant the tree in my backyard since i have the bigger backyard .
evoking_tree	we , first , got all of our utensils and started planting the tree .
screv_other_tree_tree	we dug a hole and poured the seeds inside the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	we covered it up with dirt .
screv_water_tree	we then poured water over it .
screv_water_tree	every day , we would water the seed .
relnscrev_tree	we always hoped that the tree will miraculousy grow in weeks but we knew that was n't possible .
relnscrev_tree	it would take years for it to grow .
evoking_tree	we were so happy about planting our first tree that we decided to help our community parks now .
evoking_tree	we decided to help plant trees there as well .
relnscrev_tree	it may take years , but we know that we are contributing to our environment .
<end_of_story>
screv_get_tree_tree	my parents had purchased a new lemon tree that they wanted to plant , so i went to their house to help them plant it .
relnscrev_tree	my dad already had a place picked out to put the tree , so we went to work .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we had to dig a fairly large hole
relnscrev_tree	and it took several hours .
screv_other_tree_tree	we had to take a break half way through because it was rather tiring .
relnscrev_tree	after the water break , we finished digging and we tested the depth by setting the bundled roots into the hole to make sure that it was deep enough .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	since it was , i added some of the nutrient rich soil additives into the bottom of the hole
screv_water_tree	and my dad watered the soil additives with the garden hose .
relnscrev_tree	we then cut the burlap off that had covered the roots
screv_place_root_tree	and carefully set the tree into the hole .
screv_other_tree_tree	we took another break and then set in to refilling the hole with dirt .
relnscrev_tree	it took a long time to do , but it was well worth it .
relnscrev_tree	i left the hose turned on at the base of the tree so that it could get properly soaked and we went back into the house to properly cool off .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	since it 's spring now , i decided that my yard needed another tree in it .
screv_find_place_tree	i walked around the yard for a while deciding where i wanted to put it .
screv_find_place_tree	once i picked the spot out , i got online and looked up what kinds of trees grow best in my area .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i decided on a nice pine tree
screv_other_tree_tree	and headed to the nursery .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i took a little time looking at their pine trees until i found the one i liked .
screv_get_tree_tree	i bought it
relnscrev_tree	and some topsoil to plant it in and got them loaded into my car .
unrelev_tree	once i was home ,
screv_get_tools_tree	i grabbed my shovel and went out to the place i wanted to put the tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i started digging and kept at it until i had a hole deep
relnscrev_tree	and wide enough to fit the little tree in .
screv_place_root_tree	i put it in the hole
screv_get_tools_tree	and filled around it with the nice topsoil i bought so i had good dirt to start growing in .
relnscrev_tree	i spread out the dirt i had taken out of the hole so i did n't have a pile of dirt ,
screv_other_tree_tree	then watered the tree and put my tools away .
unrelev_tree	i knwo it will take years , but that tree is going to look great once it ; s bigger .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_tree	springtime is upon us and there 's no better time to get outdoors and work on landscaping .
evoking_tree	an easy way to improve your yard is to plant a tree .
unrelev_tree	head on over to your local home
screv_choose_tree_tree	and garden store and pick out an appropriate tree .
screv_get_tools_tree	if you do n't have one already , pickup a shovel as well .
screv_other_tree_tree	head out to your yard
screv_find_place_tree	and carefully scope out a great spot to plant the tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	if you have any questions about digging , make sure to contact your local government authority to make sure there are no pipes underground !
screv_find_place_tree	once you have a safe spot ,
screv_get_tree_tree	dig a whole large enough to fit the tree that your purchased and make sure to save the dirt .
screv_refill_hole_tree	after you plant the tree in the ground , make sure to fill in this hole
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	and pack it tight .
screv_water_tree	if it 's been dry in your area make sure to water the tree in order to help it grow .
unrelev_tree	enjoy the reduction in your carbon footprint !

evoking_tree	on arbor day this year , i decided to plant a new tree in my front yard .
relnscrev_tree	i went out and dug a hole where i decided the tree would go , and i kept the dirt i dug up off to the side for easy access to replant with .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i got in my car and drove to the local nursery to look at trees .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i had an idea of what i wanted in mind , but they had so many different trees when i got there that i had a very hard time deciding .
screv_choose_tree_tree	finally , i just decided to go with the tree i had originally planned to purchase .
unrelev_tree	i went to the cashier
screv_get_tree_tree	and paid for the tree
screv_other_tree_tree	and loaded it in my truck to drive home .
unrelev_tree	once i got home ,
screv_other_tree_tree	i brought the tree out to the spot in my yard
screv_dig_hole_tree	where i had dug the hole .
relnscrev_tree	i unwrapped the bottom of the tree that had been wrapped up to prevent a mess ,
screv_find_place_tree	and i placed it in the dirt .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i packed the dirt i had dug up around the bottom of the tree to keep it secure ,
screv_tie_stakes_up_tree	and i watered it and tied some stakes up to keep the tree level and upright .
evoking_tree	that 's how i planted a tree .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	planting a tree is a wonderful thing you can do for your community and your environment .
unrelev_tree	trees provide with life sustaining oxygen .
unrelev_tree	they are also beautiful and we need them from , something to build a fort in , to wood to build our homes .
screv_find_place_tree	plant a tree by selecting the species you think would be best suited for the location and soil that you have .
screv_dig_hole_tree	you then dig a hole that will keep the top of the rootball just slightly below ground level and the base of the tree just so it can have a shallow circle made around it .
screv_refill_hole_tree	fill in some fresh soil or even compost made from old rotting leaves and grass clippings .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	this will help fertilize the tree and if you want you can add some fertilizer .
screv_refill_hole_tree	cover it up and make a small ring around the base of the tree to help catch water .
screv_water_tree	then water the tree for a good long time
relnscrev_tree	so the roots will grow deep .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	the only time i have ever planted a tree was as a memorial .
screv_get_tree_tree	we had raised the funds to buy the tree .
screv_choose_tree_tree	then i went to home depot to pick out the tree .
relnscrev_tree	i know nothing about trees , so i had the employee at home depot help me .
screv_choose_tree_tree	she helped me decide the best tree for the area that we were planting it .
unrelev_tree	one that would n't need much work or upkeep .
relnscrev_tree	then she showed me what else i would need for the tree .
screv_get_tools_tree	i bought soil and a shovel .
screv_take_home_tree	we went to the park where we were planting the tree and dug the hole for the tree .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	after we place the tree and put in the supports ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	we filled the hole back in ,
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	packing the soil tight .
unrelev_tree	we said a few words
screv_water_tree	and watered the tree .
unrelev_tree	lastly , we put the memorial plaque in front of the tree since it was a memorial for someone who has passed .
<end_of_story>
screv_other_tree_tree	yesterday i went to the nursery
screv_get_tree_tree	and bought a baby apple tree about three feet tall .
unrelev_tree	i 've always loved apple trees .
screv_take_home_tree	i carried it home in my pickup truck .
screv_get_tools_tree	i grabbed my shovel from the shed and started to dig a hole out in the corner of my backyard .
screv_dig_hole_tree	as i was shoveling i started to hit some rocky soil , and i decided to try the other far back corner of my yard .
screv_dig_hole_tree	the hole took about 23 minutes to dig , and i was exhausted from the work and the heat .
screv_place_root_tree	i was able to fit the tree perfectly into the hole
screv_other_tree_tree	and then took a break to drink some lemonade .
screv_refill_hole_tree	after about 23 minutes i started to refill the dirt around the tree .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	after packing the dirt down ,
screv_water_tree	i saturated the ground around the tree with water .
unrelev_tree	i hope that the tree is n't too shocked and it actually lives .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	yesterday during the day i decided to plant a tree with my friend bob .
screv_get_tree_tree	the first thing that we did was go and buy a little tree from the local walmart .
screv_take_home_tree	we then went into my backyard and begun to did a hole .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we got the hole to about halfway the size we wanted it and decided to take a break for lemonade .
screv_dig_hole_tree	next we continued digging , all the while i am contemplating the small part in ensuring an eco friendly future .
screv_dig_hole_tree	as the sweat pours down my face we finish the hole .
screv_place_root_tree	me and bob gently place the small tree in the hole .
unrelev_tree	now we prepared for the truly fun part .
relnscrev_tree	putting back into the ground all the dirt that we had just put there .
screv_refill_hole_tree	we filled the hole
screv_water_tree	and then watered my new plant .
relnscrev_tree	after we finished me and bob sat back with a beer overlooking this new tree that we had planted .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	last spring , i planted a tree in my backyard .
unrelev_tree	when i was a kid , we always had apples , because we had two apple trees in our backyard .
unrelev_tree	we used to make pies and applesauce and i wanted to have that at my house .
screv_get_tree_tree	i went to the local nursery
screv_choose_tree_tree	and i found a 23 foot tree .
relnscrev_tree	with delivery , it was pretty expensive , but i figured it was worth it .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i dug out an area in my backyard .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i was surprised at how long it took and how much dirt that i had to move .
screv_dig_hole_tree	digging the hole took me the longest time of the whole process .
screv_place_root_tree	i finally got that done and i stuck the tree in the ground .
relnscrev_tree	i read online about a fertilizer that was good for apple trees
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	and mixed that in with the dirt as i was filling in the area around the roots .
relnscrev_tree	i do n't expect to get any apples this year and probably not next year , but the tree should be mature enough to start producing apples in the following years .
evoking_tree	the whole process took me about 23 hours to get the tree planted .
unclear_tree	i wish i would have paid someone to do it for me .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_tree	i went to my grandmother 's house this summer and she loves to garden .
evoking_tree	she asked me to help her plan a lemon tree in her front yard .
screv_dig_hole_tree	since my grandmother was elderly and did n't have enough strength to shovel i did it instead .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i dug a hole big enough from the tree .
screv_get_tools_tree	my grandmother had gone out to our local garden center
screv_get_tree_tree	and picked out a young lemon tree from their nursery .
screv_unwrap_root_tree	i grabbed the lemon tree from the pot
screv_place_root_tree	and placed the bottom of the tree into the hole .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i cover the roots and the hole with soil until it was all covered up .
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	my grandmother sprinkled fertilizer and other plant nutrients into the soil .
screv_water_tree	while she was doing that i grabbed the hose and turned the water on .
relnscrev_tree	i walked towards the lemon tree
screv_water_tree	and sprinkled water into the soil .
unrelev_tree	hopefully the next time my grandmother and i meet to get to make lemonade .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	last weekend i thought it would be neat to make my back yard more lively .
screv_get_tree_tree	i went to the local landscaping store
screv_choose_tree_tree	and picked out some trees i thought would look nice in my yard .
relnscrev_tree	after returning home i called to my kids to come help me install the new plants .
screv_get_tools_tree	we all grabbed shovels , gloves , and buckets and went to work .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we dug holes around the yard where we thought it would be nice to have the trees grow .
screv_choose_tree_tree	we carefully each picked our favorite tree for each spot .
screv_place_root_tree	once we had settled on the location of each tree we set them in the holes
screv_refill_hole_tree	and covered them back up with dirt .
screv_water_tree	after placing some mulch around each tree to hold moisture it was time to water the plants .
screv_water_tree	we were all pretty worn out by this time so we played rock , paper , scissors to determine who would have to get the hose and water the new trees .
screv_water_tree	i ended up losing the game and was assigned the task of watering .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	i had never planted a tree before , so before we planted one , i had to do a lot of research .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i had to look up what kind of tree would work best in my climate .
relnscrev_tree	i had to see which ones needed certain levels of care ,
screv_choose_tree_tree	look up different tree diseases , and the prices of some trees .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i had to find something that would work well in my yard .
screv_choose_tree_tree	when we finally picked a perfect tree ,
screv_take_home_tree	we had to take it home .
unrelev_tree	it was very heavy !
screv_get_tree_tree	once we had it home ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	we had to dig a very big hole .
screv_place_root_tree	after you roll the tree into the hole , you have to do something called facing the tree , which means you put the tree in the position you are happy with the already existing branches growing .
relnscrev_tree	you do n't want a huge branch going right toward your house !
relnscrev_tree	to make facing easier ,
screv_water_tree	you should fill the hole halfway with water
screv_place_root_tree	before putting the tree inside .
relnscrev_tree	after you face the tree ,
screv_refill_hole_tree	fill in the dirt , and pat yourself on the back for a job well done .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_tree	last year , i was outside working in the garden when i realized that my front yard would like much nicer
relnscrev_tree	if i planted a tree to provide it with a little shade .
screv_get_tree_tree	i went to the gardeners store down the street and pick up some seeds to plant my tree .
relnscrev_tree	i decided on a maple tree as that would look nice and make a perfect amount of shade for my front lawn .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i dug a small hole where i wanted to plant the tree and put the seeds in place .
relnscrev_tree	every few weeks i noticed that the tree started to grow more
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	and more as i provided it with the correct amount of water and nutrients .
relnscrev_tree	after about 23 months the tree i had planted was nearly fully grown and looked wonderful next to me garden .
relnscrev_tree	i was very satisfied with the entire situation and love the idea of plants growing from the ground .
<end_of_story>
evoking_tree	last year i planted a fig tree with my grandfather .
evoking_tree	ordinarily we would n't have to plant a tree ,
relnscrev_tree	but his old tree had died over the winter .
unrelev_tree	we live in kind of a cold climate
relnscrev_tree	so fig trees really do n't grow well here , and if they do you usually wo n't get figs .
relnscrev_tree	they 're more often used as ornamental plants around here , but the trees my grandfather has always produce figs .
relnscrev_tree	after we got rid of the old tree , we planted the new one near where the old one had been .
relnscrev_tree	the important thing about growing these kinds of trees in this area is getting them to survive the winter .
screv_get_tools_tree	what we did was we got a bunch of maple leaves and some chicken wire fencing .
screv_other_tree_tree	we wrapped the chicken wire around the tree and stuffed the space between with the leaves .
screv_other_tree_tree	then we wrapped the whole thing with an insulated landscaping tarp .
unrelev_tree	we will know in a couple of weeks
relnscrev_tree	if the new tree survived the winter .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_tree	i went out to my backyard with the appropriate tools needed to plant my tree .
screv_choose_tree_tree	i was planning on planting an orange tree
relnscrev_tree	as i could harvest the oranges once they become ripe .
screv_dig_hole_tree	i started digging into the soil where my old tree used to be -lrb-
relnscrev_tree	but was unfortunately torn down as a result of old age and danger of power lines ,
screv_other_tree_tree	but i got the clear to plant another tree if i had wished -rrb- .
screv_refill_hole_tree	i then planted my several orange tree seeds into the ground , and started covering them with dirt again .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	i tilled the dirt over and around the planted seeds to smooth out the surface .
screv_get_tools_tree	i then took my garden hose
screv_water_tree	and watered the area for about ten to fifteen minutes .
screv_water_tree	once i was done with watering , i made sure the seeds did not get flooded to the surface of the soil
screv_water_tree	as a result of my watering , to which i noticed they had been finely secured underground .
screv_other_tree_tree	i put my materials away and went back into my house .
<end_of_story>
screv_get_tree_tree	i found a beautiful little tree at the local nursery and brought it home to plant in my garden .
screv_find_place_tree	i had already picked the spot it was to go ,
relnscrev_tree	a place in the middle of my yard where it could get full sun .
screv_get_tools_tree	after gathering the shovel and watering hose , and putting on my gardening gloves ,
screv_dig_hole_tree	i set to work on digging the hole .
screv_place_root_tree	i had to make sure the hole was deep enough to fit its roots comfortably .
screv_water_tree	i dampened the soil in the hole with a little water .
unrelev_tree	once the hole was ready ,
relnscrev_tree	i laid the tree on its side
screv_unwrap_root_tree	and gently removed the pot from it .
screv_place_root_tree	i placed the sapling into the hole and looked to see that the base of its trunk would be level with the ground , then began scraping the soil back into the hole , over the roots .
screv_tamp_dirt_tree	i tamped the soil down ,
relnscrev_tree	so as to prevent any air pockets ,
screv_water_tree	and watered it once more .
unrelev_tree	i think this little tree will make a wonderful addition to my yard !
<end_of_story>
unrelev_tree	last year when i worked for a friend doing landscaping jobs ,
evoking_tree	we often had to plant trees .
screv_choose_tree_tree	generally , we would choose a tree from a near by plant store based on what our customer desired .
screv_get_tree_tree	trees can be purchased at all different ages , from very small to the size of a large pot .
screv_get_tree_tree	then , after buying the tree or trees ,
screv_other_tree_tree	we would purchase mulch , or fertilizer ,
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	to give the tree the proper nutrients
relnscrev_tree	so it can grow big and strong .
screv_get_tree_tree	after the tree and fertilizer is purchased , we were off the house to perform our various activities .
unrelev_tree	we lived in a desert environment ,
screv_other_tree_tree	so we first had to push all the rocks out of the way with either a rake , a hoe , or one of our other tools .
screv_other_tree_tree	after clearing the area in the yard for the tree ,
screv_get_tools_tree	we then took our shovels and started digging away in the area chosen to plant the tree .
screv_dig_hole_tree	we had to dig our hole big enough so that the entire bottom of the tree with roots
relnscrev_tree	and dirt fits snugly into the ground .
unrelev_tree	after that is done ,
screv_place_fertilizers_tree	we would fill the hole with a mixture of mulch
screv_dig_hole_tree	and the dirt we pulled up when we first shoveled our hole open .
screv_place_root_tree	after the tree has been firmly planted ,
screv_water_tree	we either had to turn on the sprinklers in the lawn ,
screv_get_tools_tree	or find the nearest hose
screv_water_tree	and water the plants for about five to ten minutes .
