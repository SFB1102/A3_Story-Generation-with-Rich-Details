screv_eat_cake	today i decided to bake a cake so we could have it for dessert with tonight 's dinner .
unrelev_cake	i thought a chocolate cake would be nice ,
screv_choose_recipe_cake	so i took out my cookbook and looked for a recipe for chocolate cake .
unrelev_cake	there were a few different chocolate cake recipes ,
screv_choose_recipe_cake	but i picked one that was called devil 's food cake .
relnscrev_cake	the recipe had a list of ingredients ,
screv_get_ingredients_cake	so i checked my cupboard to make sure i had everything i would need .
unrelev_cake	when i was sure i did ,
screv_get_utensils_cake	i got out 23 mixing bowls and a cake pan .
screv_preheat_cake	the recipe said to preheat the oven to 23 degrees , so i turned the oven on and set the temperature for 23 .
screv_get_ingredients_cake	then i took a bit of butter
screv_grease_cake_tin_cake	and rubbed it all over the inside of the cake pan .
relnscrev_cake	that would make sure the cake did n't stick in the pan
screv_take_out_cake_tin_cake	and i would be able to get it out without any trouble .
screv_get_utensils_cake	i got out my electric mixer and put the beaters in , then plugged the mixer in the electrical outlet .
relnscrev_cake	as i read the directions from the recipe ,
screv_get_ingredients_cake	i put the butter and sugar in one of the bowls .
relnscrev_cake	i put the beaters in the bowl and turned on the electric mixer , holding it really tightly
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	as it mixed the butter and sugar until it was fluffy .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	i cracked some eggs ,
screv_add_ingredients_cake	and added them to the bowl
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	and beat that some more .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	in another bowl i mixed flour , baking powder , cocoa powder and all the rest of the dry ingredients .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	then i mixed the wet ingredients with the dry ones
screv_make_dough_cake	and mixed them all together with the electric mixer until the batter was smooth .

screv_pour_dough_cake	i poured the batter in my cake pan
screv_put_cake_oven_cake	and put it in the oven .
screv_wait_cake	the recipe said it would take 23 minutes to cook ,
screv_set_time_cake	so i looked at the clock in my kitchen to see what time it was .

screv_wait_cake	when 23 minutes was up ,
screv_check_cake	i opened the oven and looked at the cake .
screv_wait_cake	it looked done , but to be sure i took a toothpick and stuck it in the middle of the cake .
screv_check_cake	if it came out clean , i 'd know the cake was done .
screv_check_cake	if it came out full of wet cake batter , it was not done yet , and would need a bit longer to cook .
screv_check_cake	the toothpick came out clean .
screv_check_cake	my cake was done .

evoking_cake	i like baking cakes with my granddaughter .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	i let her help pour in the ingredients and mix them together .
screv_get_ingredients_cake	i take a box of cake mix to her house so we can bake a cake together .
screv_choose_recipe_cake	we read the directions on the back of the box of cake mix .
screv_get_ingredients_cake	then we get out everything needed to make the cake .
screv_get_ingredients_cake	we usually need eggs , cooking oil , and water or milk .
screv_get_utensils_cake	we also need a cake pan , a large mixing bowl , a measuring cup , and a mixing spoon .
screv_get_utensils_cake	also it helps to make sure we have pot holders and a spatula .
relnscrev_cake	i pre-heat the oven to the temperature given in the directions .
screv_grease_cake_tin_cake	then i grease or oil the cake pan
relnscrev_cake	so the cake does not stick to the pan .
screv_grease_cake_tin_cake	usually the directions want me to add a little flour to the pan to coat the oil , but i like to use sugar instead
relnscrev_cake	because it does not leave the outside of the cake looking like flour .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	we start by carefully cracking the egg shell
relnscrev_cake	and pouring the egg into a small cup or bowl to make sure we do not have a bad egg .
screv_add_ingredients_cake	then we pour it into the mixing bowl .
unclear_cake	if we need more than one egg ,
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	we do each one separately the same way .
screv_add_ingredients_cake	then we measure out the amount of oil needed and pour it into the mixing bowl , too .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	then my granddaughter mixes up the eggs and oil really well .
relnscrev_cake	next , i measure out the amount of liquid -lrb- water or milk -rrb- called for in the directions .
screv_add_ingredients_cake	she adds the liquid to the egg
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	and oil mixture and stirs it all up really well .
screv_add_ingredients_cake	then we add the cake mix , a little at a time ,
screv_make_dough_cake	stirring well to mix .
screv_pour_dough_cake	then i pour the cake batter into the baking pan
relnscrev_cake	and spread it evenly with a spatula .
screv_put_cake_oven_cake	next , i carefully put the cake pan into the oven
screv_check_cake	and set a timer to check it to see if it is done .
screv_check_cake	we check to see if it is done by putting a clean toothpick into the center of the cake .
relnscrev_cake	if it comes out with little or none of the cake batter stuck to the toothpick ,
screv_take_out_oven_cake	it is done and ready to take out of the oven ,
relnscrev_cake	using pot holders .
relnscrev_cake	if there is still gooey stuff on the toothpick ,

screv_preheat_cake	while it was preheating , i got to work .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	i mixed the wet ingredients together in a big bowl , and then slowly started adding the dry ingredients .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	i used a blender to stir the ingredients together .

evoking_cake	the simplest way to make cake is with a mix .
screv_add_ingredients_cake	just open the box and mix in some eggs , some water , and maybe some oil .
screv_grease_cake_tin_cake	grease two round pans by rubbing them with a stick of butter ,
screv_pour_dough_cake	pour in the batter ,
relnscrev_cake	bake as directed and you are done .
evoking_cake	making a coffee cake with bisquick baking mix is only slightly harder , but the product is not really what some people call a cake .
screv_decorate_cake	there are also delicious cakes that are really store-bought baked goods layered with ice cream .
relnscrev_cake	but for a birthday , an actual homemade cake is traditional .
evoking_cake	i make such a cake in two separate bowls
screv_add_ingredients_cake	and then combine the mixtures .
screv_get_utensils_cake	i also use a stand mixer , though even that can feel like cheating .
screv_get_ingredients_cake	first , i lay out all my ingredients ,
screv_preheat_cake	and preheat the oven .
screv_grease_cake_tin_cake	i prepare two round pans , by greasing with butter or pan spray , sprinkling with flour and shaking out the excess .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	next , i cream the butter and sugar together , on a medium-high mixer setting .
screv_add_ingredients_cake	then i mix in eggs and then vanilla .
screv_add_ingredients_cake	in a separate bowl , i combine the flour , baking powder , and salt .
screv_add_ingredients_cake	now , i add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture , a little at a time , alternating with the milk ,
screv_make_dough_cake	while i mix at medium high .
screv_make_dough_cake	it is important not to over mix , so i only combine until the lumps are gone and it looks glossy .
screv_pour_dough_cake	i fill the pans evenly ,
screv_put_cake_oven_cake	and place in the oven so they do not touch and one is not directly above the other .
screv_wait_cake	when the time is up ,
screv_wait_cake	or they smell done ,
screv_check_cake	i press lightly in the center of the cake with one finger .
screv_wait_cake	if it springs back it is done .
screv_cool_down_cake	i cool on a wire rack ,
screv_take_out_cake_tin_cake	run a knife around the edge , invert it on a plate to remove while still warm .
screv_decorate_cake	i frost liberally , and i do n't forget the candles .

evoking_cake	i love to make cheesecake for my family .
evoking_cake	we have a family recipe that i follow when i cook .
screv_get_ingredients_cake	first i purchase the ingredients at the store
relnscrev_cake	and make certain i have everything i need .
unrelev_cake	then i make a crust from scratch in a cake pan , using crumbled cookies , nuts , brown sugar and vanilla flavor .
screv_preheat_cake	i turn on the oven to pre-heat , as my oven is very slow to heat up .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	i use my electric mixer to whip the pats of cream cheese , making sure they are light and fluffy .
screv_add_ingredients_cake	then i add in eggs , sugar ,
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	lemon juice and lemon zest until it is thoroughly combined into a thick liquid .
screv_preheat_cake	i pour the mixture into the prepared cake pan and put it into the preheated oven for about 23 minutes .

evoking_cake	so while most people will talk about baking a basic cake out of a box , i am actually going to be writing about re-learning how to bake one from scratch .
unrelev_cake	i just found out that i have a gluten intolerance . like , very gluten intolerant .
unrelev_cake	so , i am re-learning how to do just about everything .
screv_get_ingredients_cake	most of the time , you can just buy stuff from a box
screv_add_ingredients_cake	and add some eggs , oil and milk and call it good .
evoking_cake	well , as there are very few gluten free baking premade box mixes , and even fewer that actually taste good , i have been teaching myself how to bake from scratch .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	all i really have to do is mix and match different flours .
unrelev_cake	wheat flour is sticky and fluffy , but keeps moisture well .
unrelev_cake	that is part of the reason
evoking_cake	so many bake with it .
unrelev_cake	if i just use rice flour , that is top dry .
unrelev_cake	if i just use coconut flour , well then it all crumbles .
screv_get_ingredients_cake	so , what i do is buy several different kinds of flours
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	so i can mix and match their properties and actually make tasty things that are extremely similar to the real deal .
screv_add_ingredients_cake	after i get the flours combined , i just add the regular ingredients , figure out a baking temperature
screv_put_cake_oven_cake	and stick it in .
unrelev_cake	right now i keep a close eye on the food since there are n't a ton of good recipes out there .
unrelev_cake	so far it has worked out well !
<end_of_story>
screv_get_utensils_cake	i grabbed a recipe book .
screv_choose_recipe_cake	i looked up a cake that i thought my wife might like .
unrelev_cake	i thought a devil 's food cake would be perfect .
screv_preheat_cake	i started by preheating the oven to 23 degrees .
screv_get_ingredients_cake	i got down the dry ingredients - flour , sugar , baking powder ,
screv_other_cake_cake	cocoa powder - measured out the quantities the recipe said and put them in a bowl .
screv_get_ingredients_cake	then i got the wet ingredients - eggs , oil ,
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	milk - and mixed those up in a separate bowl .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	then i combined the two bowls together
screv_make_dough_cake	and mixed them thoroughly .
screv_pour_dough_cake	i poured the contents into two pans
screv_put_cake_oven_cake	and then put them in the oven .
screv_take_out_oven_cake	about a half hour later i took the two pans out of the oven and let them cool .
unrelev_cake	when they were cool enough ,
screv_get_ingredients_cake	i took a can on frosting out of the cupboard
screv_decorate_cake	and iced the two layers , stacking on on the other .
unrelev_cake	i thought it looked pretty good .
<end_of_story>
evoking_cake	baking a cake either for myself or for friends is a fun activity .
screv_other_cake_cake	i first plan ahead , so i know what kind of cake i will be making and what supplies i will need for that cake .
screv_grease_cake_tin_cake	i prepare my pans , so the cake wo n't stick to the sides or bottom
screv_preheat_cake	and preheat my oven
screv_put_cake_oven_cake	so that when my batter is mixed it can go right into the oven .
unrelev_cake	a simple cake will usually require eggs , flower , baking powder and a few other things .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	generally speaking i will mix the wet ingredients in one bowl
screv_make_dough_cake	and the dry in another before mixing them together .
unrelev_cake	i like to use an industrial strength mixing bowl , as opposed to a hand mixer .
screv_make_dough_cake	i make sure that it is well mixed with no lumps , but not overly mixed , as that can ruin the batter .
unrelev_cake	once the batter is smooth
screv_put_cake_oven_cake	and yummy i pour it into the prepared pans and pop them in the over for about 20-30 minutes .
screv_wait_cake	while the actually baking takes place ,
relnscrev_cake	i can prepare the frosting .

evoking_cake	on every christmas day my wife makes very delicious fruit cake .
unrelev_cake	it is her own recipe .
screv_eat_cake	everyone who had tasted the cake before asked her the recipe .
screv_eat_cake	we like to have the cake with red wine .
evoking_cake	she needs a lot of preparations beforehand to make this cake .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	she soaked raisins , nuts , and some dried fruits in rum and kept in an airtight container for 23 days .
unrelev_cake	after 23 days these fruits absorbed rum and adopted a good flavor .
unrelev_cake	so she usually starts her cake preparation almost 23 days prior to christmas .
evoking_cake	on christmas eve she started baking process .
unrelev_cake	she usually make 5-6 cakes for us and for some friends .

evoking_cake	i love too cook .
evoking_cake	cooking is far easier than most people think , in fact , i believe that it is often as easy to make good food from scratch as it is to make something from a box , and it tastes a million times better .
unrelev_cake	one of the best examples of this is a simple cake .
unrelev_cake	a basic yellow cake takes only a few ingredients ; flour , sugar , eggs milk , baking powder , salt , vanilla , and water .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	once a person sifts the dry ingredients together it is the same a making a box cake mix .
unrelev_cake	the time and directions are nearly identical , but the result is much cheaper and more delicious than anything out of a box .
screv_wait_cake	while the cake is baking it is wise to make a good frosting for the cake , once someone has home made frosting , the stuff in a can tastes only like chemicals .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	frosting is even easier than the cake to prepare , vanilla butter cream frosting the just ; powdered sugar , vanilla , butter and milk .
screv_prepare_ingredients_cake	when mixed in the correct proportions and whipped up this is the perfect topping for any cake , and with food coloring is an excellent medium for any decorated cakes , because any color will take easily to the stark white base .
relnscrev_cake	once the cake is baked it is important to watch it ,
screv_decorate_cake	to be sure it cools enough before removing it from the pan to frost .
unrelev_cake	a cake plate -lrb- the kind on a small pedestal -rrb- is the perfect thing to make guests fawn over this quick and easy dessert .
