screv_get_ticket_bus	i swiped my bus card to pay , smiled at the driver ,
screv_find_place_bus	and chose a seat .

unrelev_bus	i live near blacksburg , virginia and often stay with friends who live near virginia tech .
evoking_bus	a bus route stops at their apartment complex
evoking_bus	and we often ride it downtown to eat brunch after a late night .
unrelev_bus	nothing unusual ever happens .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	we get ready and go to the bus stop .
unrelev_bus	there 's a bench and it 's covered but there 's no doors .
screv_bus_comes_bus	the bus is always on time
screv_board_bus_bus	and we hop on .
relnscrev_bus	it 's never crowded so we can always find a seat .
screv_board_bus_bus	the varying bus drivers are nice and we hop on ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	pay ,
screv_find_place_bus	and take our seats .
relnscrev_bus	the ride downtown takes about 23 minutes because of other stops .
unrelev_bus	no other passengers ever talk to each other and honestly groups of friends from different races stick together .
relnscrev_bus	being near a college such as virginia tech makes for a very diverse area where different cultures intermingle but the bus seems to have the most obviously segregated groups .
screv_ride_bus	we get to our stop and enjoy brunch .
screv_ride_bus	i like riding the bus because of the convenience factor , no parking , and it feels like we are doing something to help the environment .

unrelev_bus	last saturday , i decided to visit a friend in the hospital .
unrelev_bus	i own a car , but it 's been acting up lately ,
evoking_bus	so i needed to take the bus .
unrelev_bus	i set out from my apartment with a spring in my step , because it was an amazing day .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i walked through my apartment complex 's parking lot to reach the bus stop ,
screv_wait_bus	where i waited for the bus around 23 minutes .
screv_bus_comes_bus	when it came to a stop in front of me ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	i boarded and put a $ 23 bill and 23 quarters in the fare machine .
screv_find_place_bus	i selected a seat near the entrance ,
relnscrev_bus	because it has more space and fewer people .
relnscrev_bus	riding the bus often gives me motion sickness , so i closed my eyes and tried to ignore the swaying motion as it rolled down the street .
unrelev_bus	behind me , two college students were eagerly discussing a class project .
unrelev_bus	in the very back , a small child was loudly pretending to be a dinosaur .
unrelev_bus	i was glad
screv_other_bus_bus	when i finally reached my destination .
relnscrev_bus	i pulled the cord signaling that i would need the bus to stop next to the hospital ,
screv_get_off_bus	and got up to exit out the bus 's side door .
unrelev_bus	fresh air never smelled so good !
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bus	my husband and i decided we 'd go down to owning just one car in the fall of 23 .
unrelev_bus	i was not going to be working away from home during 23 so we thought we could share and most of the time that went pretty well , but there were times
evoking_bus	when i had to take the bus .
unrelev_bus	i knew i needed to get from a final day of teaching , for example , at the university to downtown to meet up with my husband .
screv_other_bus_bus	i checked the bus schedules online and determined i needed to take the number 7 bus .
screv_other_bus_bus	i plotted this out on my phone as well so i 'd know the time for sure .
screv_wait_bus	i walked across campus and waited at the stop .
screv_wait_bus	i had to wait about 23 minutes

screv_get_ticket_bus	since this was just one trip i had cash that i put into the bus meter
screv_find_place_bus	and found a seat .
screv_bus_stops_bus	the bus made a lot of stops on its way to downtown
relnscrev_bus	and i did n't take it as far as i could have to meet up with my husband .
screv_get_off_bus	instead i got off at an earlier stop once i recognized the area and walked .
unrelev_bus	it was a regular stop
relnscrev_bus	so i did n't have to pull the cord to ask the driver to let me off .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bus	i needed to get to the craft store , there was a sale !
unrelev_bus	unfortunately , husband had the car and he would be gone a while .

screv_get_ticket_bus	and put the money into the machine to pay for my ride .
screv_find_place_bus	i took a seat at an open place
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	and looked out the window .
unrelev_bus	the store i was going to was only a few stops away and when i saw we were close ,
relnscrev_bus	i pulled the cord to signal to the driver i was ready to get off .
screv_bus_stops_bus	he stopped at the shopping center
relnscrev_bus	and i thanked him for the ride
screv_get_off_bus	as i stepped onto the pavement .

screv_find_place_bus	and then took my seat .

screv_find_place_bus	so i was able to take a seat near the front .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i sat quietly , playing with my cellphone .
unrelev_bus	others stared around or talked quietly amongst themselves .
screv_other_bus_bus	a bell rang every few blocks to indicate someone wanting to get off .
screv_bus_stops_bus	the bus would stop ,
screv_get_off_bus	let people off ,
screv_board_bus_bus	and let new people on .

screv_get_bus_stop_bus	once i got there ,

screv_bus_comes_bus	after about 23 minutes , an express bus heading to manhattan arrived .
screv_get_ticket_bus	i boarded the bus and paid the driver my fare .
screv_find_place_bus	i then walked to a window seat near the front of the bus , that was free .
unrelev_bus	it was pretty early , and the bus was initially somewhat empty .
relnscrev_bus	however , several stops later , the bus was filled with fellow commuters heading to work .
screv_other_bus_bus	along the way , the bus passed through about 23 different towns
relnscrev_bus	while traveling on local roads , before headed out to the george washington bridge to get to manhattan .
relnscrev_bus	while getting there , the bus ran into a traffic jam which caused a 23 minute delay .
relnscrev_bus	after working its way through traffic , the bus made it onto the bridge , and several minutes later ,
screv_other_bus_bus	we were at the bus terminal on 178th street .
screv_other_bus_bus	once we got there ,
screv_get_off_bus	the bus stopped and the driver let us out , whereby i then walked to the office .

evoking_bus	so i had to take the bus to work yesterday .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	the first thing i did was walk to the bus stop at the corner
screv_bus_comes_bus	and then waited for the bus to arrive .
screv_other_bus_bus	i watched the signs on the front of the buses as they approached so i would know which one to take .
unrelev_bus	when i saw the right one ,
screv_other_bus_bus	i stood up so the driver would know i want to ride .
screv_bus_stops_bus	the bus stopped and then the door opened .
screv_board_bus_bus	i climbed the steps
relnscrev_bus	and the bus driver said hello .
relnscrev_bus	you can buy a bus pass
screv_ride_bus	if you ride the bus a lot , but i do n't so i do n't have a pass .
screv_get_ticket_bus	instead , i put coins into the money receiver beside the bus driver
screv_other_bus_bus	and then i walked to where the seats are .
unrelev_bus	the bus was only about half full ,
screv_find_place_bus	so i chose a seat by myself and sat down by the window .
screv_other_bus_bus	once the bus started again , there was a little jerking motion
screv_ride_bus	as it moved forward and then we were rolling down the street .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	while i was sitting , i did n't touch anything in case it was dirty .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	instead , i kept my hands in my lap and watched people , cars and buildings out of the window .
unrelev_bus	a nice lady in the seat across from me smiled at me , but no one else paid attention to me
screv_other_bus_bus	and when the bus stopped i got up along with several other people
screv_get_off_bus	and climbed down to the street again .

screv_other_bus_bus	i checked my phone for schedules and live info on where the bus is so i could spend the least amount of time waiting for the bus .
unrelev_bus	once it was time ,
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i ran out to the bus stop with my wallet
relnscrev_bus	and my bus card - a pass containing all the fare money i use electronically .

unrelev_bus	before i left my house ,

screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i then left my house and walked to the bus stop right outside my house .

unrelev_bus	i was walking to my car last night from work and was ready to drive home .
unrelev_bus	i started the car up , but i noticed that i left my phone at work , so i turned the ignition back off , locked the car doors , and shut the driver door .
unrelev_bus	unfortunately for me , i shut the door with my keys still in the ignition .
unrelev_bus	that 's right ;
unrelev_bus	i was locked out of my own car .
unrelev_bus	flustered and embarassed , i pulled at the handles of the doors and attempted to open the trunk off the car - no luck at all .
unrelev_bus	i walked back to my office , got my phone , and contemplated what i would do next .
unrelev_bus	there was no one there with me ,
evoking_bus	so my only hope was riding the public bus -lrb- i did n't have money for a cab -rrb- .
screv_wait_bus	i waited for the bus , the last one of the night , at the bus stop .
screv_door_opens_bus	the bus driver opened the door for me
screv_board_bus_bus	and i came aboard .
screv_get_ticket_bus	i paid the two dollar bus fare

<end_of_story>
evoking_bus	after looking for a bus route to my workplace online ,
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i headed outside .
unrelev_bus	the nearest bus stop was only about a block or two away
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	so i walked over .
unrelev_bus	there were two bus stops at the same intersection , one on either side of the road .
relnscrev_bus	i made sure i was at the right stop by reading the stop location id listed on the sign next to the bus stop .
screv_bus_comes_bus	my bus arrived in about five minutes
screv_board_bus_bus	and i got on board .

screv_get_ticket_bus	after receiving the pass ,
screv_other_bus_bus	i walked inside the bus
screv_find_place_bus	and looked for the nearest , open seat .
screv_find_place_bus	i found one close to the back of the bus .
unrelev_bus	since my stop was a common one ,
relnscrev_bus	i did n't have to let the bus driver know when i needed to get off .
screv_other_bus_bus	once we arrived at my stop ,
screv_get_off_bus	me and several others all got off and went our separate ways .

evoking_bus	this past weekend i rode a public bus .
unrelev_bus	i was in a busy city
relnscrev_bus	and needed to get to a tour bus .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	after getting of the train system i was directed to the city bus .
unrelev_bus	i noticed a section of the block
relnscrev_bus	where a lot of people were standing around and the bus would stop in this area to put up passengers .
unrelev_bus	there was but after bus after bus and you had to move fast .
unrelev_bus	i was told that number 23 was my bus .
screv_other_bus_bus	so when i saw it pull up i had to push through the crowd
screv_board_bus_bus	so that i could board my bus .
screv_board_bus_bus	i was able to get on and the bus captain came over to me after a minute or so
screv_get_ticket_bus	and collected my fair .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	as i sat back to relaxed i noticed that the bus driver was driving the bus with wild abandon .
unrelev_bus	he was flying through the street
relnscrev_bus	and than squealing the brakes as he tried to keep control of the vehicle .
unrelev_bus	i just knew we were all going to die .
unrelev_bus	i was trying to get my friends attention but she was turned around and deep in a conversation .
unrelev_bus	this was a nerve racking situation not only
relnscrev_bus	because of his driving but i did n't really know my stop so i was tried to calm my heart as we nearly missed car after car
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	and look our the window to determine where the tour bus company was located .
screv_get_off_bus	it finally worked out because a few of the passengers was going to same place and directed me to get off at the right location .
unrelev_bus	they were so nice and i was able to speak with a few of them .
unrelev_bus	so , i guess i can say it was n't all bad because i made a friend or two with some of the passengers
relnscrev_bus	and i made it to my tour bus location in plenty of time for my trip home .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bus	i live in a large city , and while i do have a car , sometimes there is a lack of parking where i need to go .
unrelev_bus	when this happens or if i think it will be hard to park ,
evoking_bus	i will take the city bus .
relnscrev_bus	they have a very good bus service in our city , and you can get wherever you need to be fairly easily and quickly .
evoking_bus	i know riding the bus can be confusing at first ,
relnscrev_bus	but they make some very easy bus schedules to help people .
unrelev_bus	i knew where i needed to go ,
screv_other_bus_bus	so i took out my bus schedule and found out when the bus i needed to ride would be at the stop near my house .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i went there a few minutes early , and right on time ,
relnscrev_bus	i saw the bus i needed to ride .
relnscrev_bus	i could tell it was my bus by the big number flashing near the top of the bus .
screv_bus_comes_bus	when the bus stopped ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	i got on and put my money into the coin taker which is near the driver .
screv_other_bus_bus	i then moved to the back of the bus
screv_find_place_bus	and chose a seat .
unrelev_bus	a nice woman was sitting across from me
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	and she smiled and said hello .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i smiled and said hello in return .
unrelev_bus	people are usually very friendly on the bus .
screv_ride_bus	i rode the bus for several more stops , and then saw my stop coming up .
screv_bus_stops_bus	when the bus stopped ,
screv_get_off_bus	i got off the bus and went to my destination .
unrelev_bus	it is very easy
evoking_bus	and convenient to ride the public bus .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bus	the other day i decided not to drive into the city like i usually do ,
evoking_bus	but to take the bus instead .
evoking_bus	even though it is a ten minute walk from my house to the bus stop , it is still much more relaxing to travel by public bus instead of getting stressed driving in traffic in the city .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i walked in the sunshine to the bus stop
screv_wait_bus	where lots of other people were already waiting for the bus ,
relnscrev_bus	some of them were reading the bus timetable attached to the covered bus stop .
unrelev_bus	there was no space on the bench
screv_wait_bus	so i just stood in line and waited until i saw the big red double decker bus turn the corner and head towards us .
screv_bus_comes_bus	when the driver pulled up at the curb , people started to board the bus , it took a while as each of them had to stop to pay the driver before finding a seat but eventually it was my turn to get on board .
relnscrev_bus	i told the driver where i wanted to get off the bus
relnscrev_bus	and that i needed a return fare as i wanted to come home later .
screv_get_ticket_bus	i found the correct change to hand to the driver
relnscrev_bus	and he punched some buttons on a machine at the side of the steering wheel .
screv_get_ticket_bus	the machine printed a ticket which he gave to me and said i would have to keep safe to hand in on the return bus journey .
unrelev_bus	i decided to sit upstairs as the view of the countryside is always better from higher up ,
screv_other_bus_bus	and climbed the little spiral staircase up to the top deck
screv_find_place_bus	where i found an empty seat .
relnscrev_bus	the journey was noisy , lots of people were talking and laughing and it took a lot longer than if i was driving as the bus stopped in various villages along the way .
screv_get_off_bus	by the time i got to the city and left the bus , i was relaxed and happy and looking forward to doing some shopping .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bus	needing to go across town , i decided to take a public bus rather than drive .
relnscrev_bus	i had no bus tokens to pay for the fare
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	so i walked to the bus station downtown
screv_get_ticket_bus	and bought some .
relnscrev_bus	then i got a bus schedule and looked for a bus that was going across town .
relnscrev_bus	i would be riding bus number 23 .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	so i went out to the platform
screv_wait_bus	where a lot of other people were waiting for their buses .
unrelev_bus	i found where number 23 stopped
screv_other_bus_bus	and got in the line .
screv_bus_comes_bus	when the bus came i had my token out
relnscrev_bus	and ready to deposit in the fare collection box .
screv_find_place_bus	then i went and found a seat .
screv_find_place_bus	i was going to sit next to a woman that looked like she was going to work .
relnscrev_bus	the bus meandered through the city and finally got me to my destination .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bus	my car had broken down so i needed to take the public bus to work on wednesday morning .
screv_other_bus_bus	first i looked on-line to see which bus i should take to get to mclean , and what bus stop was the closest to my home .

screv_board_bus_bus	catch the 3a to tyson corner ,
relnscrev_bus	and then transfer to the 18a to get within a block of my office .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	in the morning i walked up to the shopping center
screv_bus_comes_bus	and waited until the bus came .
screv_board_bus_bus	i got on ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	paying the driver with change and dollar bills .
relnscrev_bus	i confirmed with the driver that this was the correct bus to go to tyson corner and transfer .
screv_find_place_bus	i chose a seat near the front so i could make sure i did not miss my next stop .
screv_change_bus_bus	i transferred at tyson corner to the 18a ,
relnscrev_bus	which took me within a block of my work place .

screv_bus_comes_bus	the number nine bus came ten minutes later .

relnscrev_bus	' the driver asked me where i was going and when i told him he said ' that ll be two seventy five .
screv_other_bus_bus	' i pulled three dollars out of my pocket
screv_get_ticket_bus	and put them in the bus money collection machine .
relnscrev_bus	the machine showed three dollars were entered and that my ride would cost two seventy five .
unrelev_bus	a quarter dropped in the drop box .
unrelev_bus	i retrieved the quarter
screv_find_place_bus	and then found a seat .
relnscrev_bus	the bus driver told i had ten stops before mine so i started counting stops .
screv_bus_stops_bus	the first stop was fifth street .
screv_bus_stops_bus	the second was hadley avenue .
screv_bus_stops_bus	the next stop was dobson .
screv_bus_stops_bus	adams was the ninth stop .
relnscrev_bus	finally , main street came up .
relnscrev_bus	i pulled the bus s rider cord to let the bus driver i wanted to get off .
screv_get_off_bus	the bus let me off in the front of the milwaukee public museum .
unrelev_bus	i spent almost the whole day there and then returned home the opposite way i came .

evoking_bus	riding a public bus is a good way to get around a city .
unrelev_bus	if i am traveling in a big city ,
evoking_bus	i think it 's easier to take the bus than depend on my car .
relnscrev_bus	in chicago , i can get anywhere in the city more quickly and inexpensively using public transit .
relnscrev_bus	first , i look online to find the stop nearest to where my hotel is .
screv_other_bus_bus	then i plan out the stops i want to make .
unrelev_bus	maybe i am going to a museum or the zoo .
relnscrev_bus	i find the bus routes that go where i want to go .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i go to the bus stop
screv_bus_comes_bus	and wait for the bus to come along .
screv_get_ticket_bus	then i hop on and pay my fare .
screv_find_place_bus	i like to sit by the window
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	and get a good glimpse of the city i am in .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	sometimes i will even see something that catches my eye
screv_get_off_bus	and i will get off before i planned !
relnscrev_bus	when it 's time for me to depart ,
screv_press_stop_button_bus	i pull the cord and let the driver know i want to get off .
screv_get_off_bus	then i get off at the next opportunity and continue on with my day without needing to deal with parking !

unrelev_bus	i wanted to go to san francisco from my home in san jose and i did n't feel like driving .
screv_other_bus_bus	i looked online and found a bus route from here to there that was leaving in just about 23 minutes .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i walked out of my house to the bus stop
screv_board_bus_bus	and got on it .
unrelev_bus	it was a very empty bus
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	and i stared out of the window at the scenery .
unrelev_bus	the bus driver was very nice and asked me how my day was .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	we spoke for the whole entire ride and after a short time ,
relnscrev_bus	we arrived into san francisco .
unrelev_bus	it was very pleasant not having to drive and it was a very smooth ride on the bus .
unrelev_bus	luckily , there was n't much traffic
relnscrev_bus	so we got there in a very short time frame .
relnscrev_bus	after getting to the bus stop ,
screv_door_opens_bus	the driver opened his doors for me
relnscrev_bus	and wished me a great day .
screv_get_off_bus	i did the same and stepped off of the bus .
unrelev_bus	it was a very easy and fun experience .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bus	i ride the bus to school everyday .
unrelev_bus	i live in new york city
evoking_bus	so riding the bus is a common thing .
relnscrev_bus	everyone does it because it is convenient .
unrelev_bus	in our city , it is very packed , so driving is n't as convenient or affordable .
unrelev_bus	parking is expensive
relnscrev_bus	so public transportation saves us a lot of money .
unrelev_bus	every morning when i go to school ,
screv_wait_bus	i wait by the bus stop .
relnscrev_bus	the morning bus comes every ten minutes .
screv_board_bus_bus	once it arrives i board onto the bus
screv_get_ticket_bus	and i insert my metro card .
relnscrev_bus	the metro card has a balance of money stored inside it .
relnscrev_bus	this money is subtracted from the balance every time i ride the bus and insert my metro card .
relnscrev_bus	basically the metro card pays for the bus ride .
unrelev_bus	when i run out of money ,
relnscrev_bus	i go to a metro card machine and put more money into my balance .
evoking_bus	riding the bus is annoying sometimes .
relnscrev_bus	in the morning , it is very crowded so sometimes there are n't enough seats for everybody .
relnscrev_bus	this means i have to stand while holding on to a pole .
unrelev_bus	sometimes its so crowded that i am sandwiched in between people .
unrelev_bus	if i am lucky ,
relnscrev_bus	sometimes there will be open seats .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	otherwise , i have to stand for 23 minutes .

evoking_bus	yesterday i decided to take the bus to the zoo .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i walked over to the bus stop and sat down on the bench
relnscrev_bus	while i waited for the bus to arrive .
relnscrev_bus	there was a map of all the bus routes at the stop ,
screv_other_bus_bus	so i looked on there to make sure i knew which bus would take me to the zoo .
unrelev_bus	i saw i needed bus number 23 .
screv_bus_comes_bus	sure enough , there came number 23 .
screv_bus_comes_bus	as the bus pulled up to the stop ,
screv_get_off_bus	the driver opened the door to let passengers off .
relnscrev_bus	once everyone who need off was off ,
screv_board_bus_bus	i climbed up the stairs , smiled at the bus driver ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	and put my money in the slot .
screv_find_place_bus	i took a seat
screv_other_bus_bus	and off we went .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i watched all the buildings go by as the driver drove the bus towards the zoo .
relnscrev_bus	there were a couple of other stops before the zoo , and at each one people got off the bus and on the bus .
relnscrev_bus	finally , we made it to the zoo .
screv_door_opens_bus	the driver opened up the door ,
screv_get_off_bus	and i climbed down out of the bus and off to my day at the zoo .

evoking_bus	yesterday i rode a public bus to go to work .
unrelev_bus	i woke up early because the bus is very very very unreliable .
unrelev_bus	i packed the items that i needed for the day in my backpack .
screv_other_bus_bus	i double checked to make sure i had everything , including my one dollar and twenty five cents bus fare .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i walked out the door and started heading in the direction of the bus stop .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i walked to the bus stop as quickly as i could
screv_wait_bus	and then waited for the bus .
screv_wait_bus	i waited about ten
screv_bus_comes_bus	and a half minutes before the bus came .
screv_get_ticket_bus	when the bus arrived i got on and paid my fare ,
screv_find_place_bus	and sat down .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	during the bus ride i listened to music to avoid hearing the loud noise of the bus motor and the other noises caused by the large number of people around me .
screv_get_off_bus	finally when i arrived at the destination i got off .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_bus	i have never had to ride a public bus until 23 years ago when i had no other transportation and was forced to take a public bus anywhere i needed to go .
screv_other_bus_bus	the first thing i had to do was find a bus schedule and learn how to read the time and places to catch the bus and how to make any needed transfers .
unrelev_bus	this was a little hard to do but once i figured it out it was ok as long
relnscrev_bus	as i always kept a schedule with me .
relnscrev_bus	i mostly took the bus to work and i only had to worry about catching one bus on the street i lived on and i did not have to sorry about any transfers .
relnscrev_bus	the bus ride cost me $ 23 and transfers where an additional 23 cents .
screv_ride_bus	many people rode the bus and i meet several nice people on the bus .
unrelev_bus	the bus drivers were always nice and i became friends with several of them .
relnscrev_bus	the bus only came once an hour and i had to make sure i did not miss it if i was going to work because then i would be late for work .
screv_bus_stops_bus	the bus always made a stop at the main depot in order to pick up more people .
relnscrev_bus	there was usually about a 23 minute wait so the driver could have break in the late afternoon .
relnscrev_bus	i did not like having to take the bus but it served my purpose for a while and i was thankful to have the bus available .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bus	tonight i road on a public bus .
relnscrev_bus	i waited outside of the store near my house for the bus which runs on a schedule .
screv_bus_comes_bus	once the bus came i got on
screv_get_ticket_bus	and paid the bus fare .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	after that i took my seat i looked around at all the other people .
evoking_bus	when you ride on the bus there can be all types of people on the bus with you .
unrelev_bus	i had my mp3 player with me with ear-buds
relnscrev_bus	so i put my ear-buds into my ears and turned on my mp3 player and began listening to my music .
unrelev_bus	my public bus ride was n't very long
screv_bus_stops_bus	so after a little while the bus stopped at my stop
screv_get_off_bus	and i got off the bus and arrived at my destination .
evoking_bus	riding on a public bus can be a fun experience if you want it to be and you can even talk to the other people on the public bus but overall i had a good experience .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bus	i live near the city of santa cruz
evoking_bus	and often take the 17x bus to the nearby city of san jose .
relnscrev_bus	it 's possible to get discount fares by paying for multiple rides in advance , but i usually pay cash , five dollars for one-way .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i get to my small town 's transit center early on weekday mornings ,
relnscrev_bus	because the bus fills up quickly , and most good seats are already taken by riders who started their trip in downtown santa cruz .
screv_wait_bus	we wait in line in civilized fashion .
relnscrev_bus	some people need only show the driver their pass , some shove a five-dollar bill into the fare machine efficiently .
relnscrev_bus	but some fumble with small coins or ask other riders for change , which makes everyone in line restive .
screv_find_place_bus	once on , riders can choose seats grouped around small tables , seats facing forward , or seats facing sideways .
unrelev_bus	table seats are premium ,
relnscrev_bus	since the bus has wifi and many people bring laptops .
unrelev_bus	others prefer seats in the back where the roughnecks are , just like in high school .
unrelev_bus	my little town is the last stop before highway 23 .
relnscrev_bus	the bus whips along amid the pine trees and the yellow-flowered acacia that blooms this time of year .
unrelev_bus	it is pleasant not to have to keep your eyes on the road .
unrelev_bus	unspoken bus etiquette decrees that strangers do n't speak to each other ,
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	but of course some people know each other and chat .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	many tap away on their machines or play video games , others read books or enjoy the ride .
unrelev_bus	it ends at san jose 's train station ,
screv_change_bus_bus	where passengers can transfer to the san francisco train ,
relnscrev_bus	or take a rattling inferior 1-hour bus ride to fremont to catch the bart mass transit line to oakland , richmond , or distant pittsburg , where the california delta begins .

evoking_bus	there is a bus stop down the street from my house .
relnscrev_bus	if you take it going south , it leads to the city , and if you take it going north , it leads to the next suburban town .
unrelev_bus	i needed to go to the city ,
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	so i went to the bus stop
screv_wait_bus	and waited .
screv_wait_bus	i waited about ten minutes
screv_bus_comes_bus	and then the bus came .
screv_bus_stops_bus	it wheezed to a stop near me
screv_door_opens_bus	and then the door opened .
screv_board_bus_bus	i walked into the bus and up the short flight of stairs toward the driver .
screv_get_ticket_bus	i had just enough change on me to pay the fare .
screv_get_ticket_bus	i fed my coins into the slot where you put your money
screv_other_bus_bus	and then walked to the left
screv_find_place_bus	and down the aisle to find my seat .
relnscrev_bus	i passed the front seats , which are intended for older or handicapped passengers ,
screv_find_place_bus	and took a seat about halfway down the bus , next to the window .
relnscrev_bus	the bus ride lasted 23 minutes .
relnscrev_bus	when i saw that my stop would be next ,
screv_press_stop_button_bus	i pulled the yellow cord that runs along the side of the bus .
relnscrev_bus	that makes a beep and signals the driver that someone wants to get off the bus .
screv_other_bus_bus	the beep sounded and the bus driver pulled over to the side of the road at the next bus stop .
screv_door_opens_bus	the doors opened .
screv_other_bus_bus	i got up and went to the rear door of the bus ,
screv_get_off_bus	walked down the stairs , and walked out onto the sidewalk .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bus	i usually do n't take the bus to work but today i decided to give it a try since the bus stop is right across the street from my house .
relnscrev_bus	when the bus came i greeted the bus driver with a friendly hello
screv_get_ticket_bus	and paid my bus fare .
screv_find_place_bus	i was lucky enough to find a seat all the way in the back .
relnscrev_bus	there was a lot of different people on the bus , some were kids going to school others were adults going to work like i was .
screv_bus_stops_bus	i watched the bus come to a stop every few blocks
screv_get_off_bus	and drop off a few people ,
screv_board_bus_bus	but for every person that left a new person got on .
relnscrev_bus	i noticed my stop was near so i pushed the strip on the wall that notifies the bus driver my stop is coming up .
screv_get_off_bus	when he pulled into the next stop i exited the back of the bus and was happy that after 23 minutes i finally reached my destination .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bus	after touring the city ,
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i arrived at the public bus stop
screv_bus_comes_bus	and took a seat on the bench waiting for the bus to arrive .
screv_check_time-table_bus	i looked at a map on what this bus 's route was ,
screv_ride_bus	and it was heading towards
relnscrev_bus	where i needed to go .
relnscrev_bus	since i am easily bored , i brought my mp3 player with me to listen to music .
screv_board_bus_bus	after a 23 minute wait the bus arrived and i got on with another person .
screv_board_bus_bus	as i walked up on the bus ,
relnscrev_bus	i paid the fee that is required since i do n't have a bus pass .
screv_find_place_bus	since most people in the city like to keep to themselves , i left them alone and found an open seat on the bus in the back .
screv_bus_stops_bus	after about 23 minutes on the bus , they finally arrived at my destination spot
screv_get_off_bus	and i got off .
screv_get_off_bus	after getting off the bus , i walked a couple more blocks over to where my hotel was .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bus	i live in an area with good train and bus coverage .
unrelev_bus	i typically choose the train as it is more predictable but for some parts of the city that the train can not reach ,
evoking_bus	i will take the bus .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	the bus stations are typically outdoors so depending on where i 'm going i 'll head to the nearest bus stop .
screv_check_time-table_bus	there 's an app that shoes when the next bus is coming so i 'll take out my phone to see how long the wait is .
screv_wait_bus	typically the wait is about 10-15 minutes .
screv_bus_comes_bus	once the bus arrives ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	i take out my transit card to tap on the machine that collects the fare .
unrelev_bus	this is done at the very beginning at the entrance of the bus .
screv_find_place_bus	once i hear the beep notifying me that the fare has been collected i will take a seat upstairs if it 's a double decker bus .
unrelev_bus	the view is much better from the top and there are usually seats at the top .
screv_get_off_bus	now it 's time to sit back and enjoy the ride and get off at my destination .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bus	i woke up early in the morning
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	and walked from my house to the road
screv_ride_bus	where the bus travels .
screv_find_bus_bus	this is a busy bus route , so there are a lot of buses i can catch at this spot .
screv_wait_bus	i waited 23 minutes and saw a bus in the distance coming my way .
screv_wait_bus	i waited patiently at the bus stop making sure the bus driver could see i wanted to board .
screv_door_opens_bus	the bus driver stopped the bus and opened the door for me .
screv_get_off_bus	i had to wait for some other passengers to get off the bus first .
screv_board_bus_bus	i walked up steps into the bus
screv_get_ticket_bus	and paid for my trip .
relnscrev_bus	there is a machine that collects money and tokens in front of the bus .
screv_find_place_bus	luckily , there was a seat available to sit in .
screv_ride_bus	i rode the bus for about 23 minutes
screv_bus_stops_bus	until we were coming close to my stop .
screv_get_off_bus	i pulled the string to tell the bus driver i wanted off .

evoking_bus	riding a public bus is n't something i look forward to doing .
screv_ride_bus	when i was a teenager some friends convinced me that it would be fun to jump on a bus and ride around .
unrelev_bus	having done so , i disagree , it is n't fun .
unrelev_bus	however , for some people the bus is the only mode of transportation available .
evoking_bus	riding the bus does require a little research .
screv_ride_bus	you have to know which line you are riding , whether it is an express or whether it will be making many stops .
screv_get_ticket_bus	you must also have the appropriate amount of fare ready to pay .
screv_find_place_bus	once on board the bus , it 's best to find a hopefully clean seat nearby a normal looking person .
unrelev_bus	since bus fare is quite cheap
evoking_bus	and anyone can use it , they do tend to attract undesirable types , so it 's best to be aware of that fact
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	and watch yourself and your belongings closely .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	listen and watch to make sure you do n't miss your stop , since busses do get crowded and you do n't want to miss it .

screv_board_bus_bus	i waited at the bus stop for my bus to come pick me up .

unrelev_bus	there were other people at the stop as well ,
screv_board_bus_bus	so i waited in lined for my turn to get on .
screv_board_bus_bus	i climbed the three steps up into the bus ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	and then deposited my change to pay for the trip .
unrelev_bus	the fare was $ 23
screv_get_ticket_bus	so i put six quarters into the box .
relnscrev_bus	then i walked down the aisle of the bus
screv_find_place_bus	and looked for an empty seat .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i found one next to a young person listening to music on their headphones .
screv_bus_leaves_bus	the bus pulled away from the curb .
screv_ride_bus	as we rode ,
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i looked out the window and watched the stores
relnscrev_bus	and houses pass by .

screv_board_bus_bus	i stepped onto the public bus
screv_get_ticket_bus	and paid for a one-way ticket .
relnscrev_bus	the trip into town took fifteen minutes
screv_bus_stops_bus	because the bus had other stops to make in the area before returning to the station .

screv_spend_time_bus_bus	and we spent most of the travel time talking .
screv_bus_stops_bus	then we reached the bus station .

relnscrev_bus	and maneuvered the bus into its numbered space .

unrelev_bus	luckily everyone who was involved came out uninjured but my car was damaged and would have to spend about two weeks in the shop .
evoking_bus	since my insurance did not cover a rent a car this meant that i had to take public transportation for the next couple of weeks to get to work .
unrelev_bus	i was fortunate to have a bus stop only a couple of blocks from my house
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	so i would walk to the bus stop
screv_wait_bus	and wait for the bus with the other people .
relnscrev_bus	some people talked to one another and others like myself had headphones in , listening to music .
relnscrev_bus	it is not that i am against talking to people i am just not really a morning person and do not feel like it at 7am .
screv_ride_bus	the bus pulled up and we got in line to board and showed him our ticket to ride .

relnscrev_bus	i always took a public bus to get there .
screv_check_time-table_bus	the first thing i would do is look up the bus route and schedule .
screv_bus_comes_bus	once i knew what time the bus would arrive ,
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i 'd walk to the bus stop
screv_wait_bus	and wait on the bench .
screv_bus_comes_bus	once the bus arrived ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	i would pay the driver via a electronic machine and was then on my life .

relnscrev_bus	at one point , the bus was full and i gave up my seat
screv_find_place_bus	so that an older lady could sit down .
screv_bus_stops_bus	once i saw that my stop was arriving ,

screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i walked down the street to the nearest bus stop that would take me close to work .
screv_bus_comes_bus	i waited for about five minutes for the bus to come .
screv_board_bus_bus	once i got on ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	i put my money in the machine
screv_find_place_bus	and headed towards the back to find a seat .
unrelev_bus	there were only three open seats
screv_find_place_bus	so i took one of them
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	and popped in my ear buds to listen to music .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i also brought a book along to read so nobody would try to talk to me .
screv_bus_stops_bus	the bus made three stops before we got to the corner nearest to my work .
relnscrev_bus	each time people would get off and as they shuffled past would bump into my knees which was really annoying .
screv_find_place_bus	then more people would get on and some would find seats , but others had to stand .
screv_find_place_bus	one person stood directly in front of me , in constant contact with my legs .
unrelev_bus	this really annoyed me even more .
evoking_bus	i don ' t like riding public transportation .
screv_bus_stops_bus	finally we got to my stop
screv_get_off_bus	and i got out of the bus through the rear doors .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_bus	my car had recently broke down and i had no mode of transportation ,
evoking_bus	i needed to ride the bus to work everyday now .
evoking_bus	i had never rode the bus before so it was kind of a daunting experience .
screv_get_ticket_bus	i looked up what i needed to do online , the first thing i needed to do was buy a bus pass in order to even ride the bus .
screv_ride_bus	after that it was relatively simple , i just had to wait for the bus that would take me nearest to my office building ,
screv_board_bus_bus	and board it .
screv_find_place_bus	once i was on i just had to scan my pass and pick a seat .
screv_bus_stops_bus	after that i just waited until i reached my stop
screv_get_off_bus	and i got off of the bus .
unclear_bus	once work was over i just did the same thing
screv_get_off_bus	and got off at the stop as close to my house as possible .
evoking_bus	riding the bus was not as scary as i thought it would be .
<end_of_story>
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i walk a few blocks from my home to the local bus stop picking up a newspaper along the way .
screv_bus_comes_bus	as the bus arrives i prepare to remove money from my wallet for the fare .
screv_board_bus_bus	as the bus stops the doors open and i walk up the metal steps and stop to pay my fare to the driver .
unrelev_bus	the bus is partially full
screv_find_place_bus	but with enough seats to choose from i select a window seat .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	being a warm day i open the window a crack to get a breeze on me .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	during my ride just out of curiosity i check out all of the other passengers before settling down to read my newspaper .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i check out the local scores in the sports section first then continue to read the remainder of the paper .
screv_get_off_bus	as the bus nears my stop i get up and walk to the exit waiting for the door to open then depart .

unrelev_bus	my boss gave me tickets to the pittsburgh penguins hockey game .
unrelev_bus	the penguins play in the downtown area of my city .
unrelev_bus	i live in a busy city so driving a car to the downtown area is n't always the best idea .
unrelev_bus	first , you have to deal with traffic .
unrelev_bus	after dealing with traffic , you have to find a place to park .
unrelev_bus	paying for parking is very expensive .
unrelev_bus	a public bus is usually the quickest way to get to downtown .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	first , i had to go to the bus stop
screv_check_time-table_bus	and get a schedule to plan my bus trip .
unrelev_bus	i did this days in advance , because i was really excited for the game .
screv_board_bus_bus	after setting the time i would get on the bus , i made sure to arrive 23 minutes early
relnscrev_bus	so i do n't miss the bus .
screv_get_ticket_bus	i got on the bus and paid my fare for the trip .

relnscrev_bus	as it passed other stops without passengers ,
screv_bus_stops_bus	and we eventually got to the transit station , where i was able to walk by foot the rest of the way to my workplace .

unrelev_bus	a few years ago we took a mexican vacation .
unrelev_bus	we heard the best way to travel is on the bus .
unrelev_bus	it was very hot and tropical .

screv_wait_bus	as we were standing there a giant gecko came out of the bushes .
unrelev_bus	they say not to get near them .
screv_board_bus_bus	we hopped on the bus .

unrelev_bus	i did , however , have enough money for bus fare .
unrelev_bus	as the job search continued i found an oportunity on the other side of town working for subway .
evoking_bus	i utilized the bus service .
unrelev_bus	the characters on the bus were generally normal people but there were always a few outliers that were a bit intimidating .
unrelev_bus	most of these reeked of alcohol and insanity .
unrelev_bus	they were probably homeless people .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i usually did n't talk to too many people on the bus , just kept to myself .
screv_bus_stops_bus	i would go to the transfer spot in downtown ,
screv_ride_bus	and switch to the bus that would take me to my final location at subway .

screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i read my book , looking occasionally out the windows , and listening for information on the next stop ,
screv_bus_stops_bus	until finally reaching the stop for home .
screv_get_off_bus	even though i stepped carefully off the bus ,

screv_wait_bus	i waited until the bus that i needed pulled up and boarded the bus .

screv_find_place_bus	and they walked quickly to their seats .

screv_find_place_bus	and took a seat at the front of the bus that was saved for elderly and handicapped people .

screv_get_ticket_bus	that people who use the bus daily buy them to save money .

unrelev_bus	where i live ,
screv_ride_bus	i always need to take a public bus to the train station to get to my destinations .
unrelev_bus	the bus is not usually on schedule so sometimes this can be frustrating especially on a cold winter day
screv_wait_bus	as you are waiting for a bus .
unrelev_bus	since the discovery of a bustimes app on my iphone , i am able to know exactlly
screv_check_time-table_bus	when my bus arrives using their gps technology .
unrelev_bus	it is accurate most of the times .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	i get ready to leave my house ,

screv_board_bus_bus	and then leave my house to catch the bus without wasting my time waiting for the bus .

unrelev_bus	last year i got a job in downtown atlanta .
unrelev_bus	i live 23 miles from the downtown .
unrelev_bus	so during commute hours it takes 1-1 23 hours to get to job .
unrelev_bus	in a day , i 'll be spending 23 hours in car with nothing else to do .
unrelev_bus	so i started thinking about alternatives .
evoking_bus	how about taking public transport ?
screv_find_bus_bus	i checked online and found a route which is closer to where i live .
screv_find_bus_bus	i found that the best stop was right in front of my apartment complex which i had never noticed before .
unrelev_bus	i started waking up by 6:30 .
screv_get_bus_stop_bus	by 23 , i 'll reach the bus stop .
screv_bus_comes_bus	the bus will come sharp at 7:10 .
screv_get_ticket_bus	i need to swipe the transport 's card or pay in cash
screv_board_bus_bus	when i get into the bus .
screv_find_place_bus	usually there will be couple of seats vacant so i do n't need to stand .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i will either sleep or read a book for the entire journey .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	or i could talk to passengers .
unrelev_bus	overall it was a nice experience .
<end_of_story>
evoking_bus	the trick to getting around an island as congested with traffic as oahu , is to ride the public bus .
unrelev_bus	there are too many cars , in too small of an area , and the result is hours of gridlock on the roads .
unrelev_bus	the bus can use special lanes , and helps reduce the overall traffic .
evoking_bus	learning to ride the public bus was a little stressful at first .
screv_check_time-table_bus	i studied bus routes online on their website , there are quite a few and it seemed like it 'd be easy to get on the wrong bus .
unrelev_bus	i learned each bus has a number assigned to it and displayed on the front though .
screv_wait_bus	with that in mind , and armed with maps , i learned to stand at my local bus stop
screv_board_bus_bus	and climb on board
screv_get_ticket_bus	where i drop my change into the toll taker next to the driver .
screv_find_place_bus	i always look for an empty seat ,
relnscrev_bus	and then relax , watching the scenery roll by .
screv_bus_stops_bus	as my stop approaches ,
screv_press_stop_button_bus	i stand and pull the bell ,
screv_bus_stops_bus	and the driver stops the bus .
evoking_bus	now that i regularly ride the public bus , i find i do n't mind the long commute nearly as much !

screv_bus_comes_bus	when it arrived ,
screv_board_bus_bus	we got into the line to board .
screv_get_ticket_bus	each person in front of us climbed the steps and put a token into the machine at the front of the bus .
unrelev_bus	we had no token ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	so we gave the bus driver our money and he gave us tokens to put in .
screv_find_place_bus	we found a seat at the back of the bus and sat down .
screv_check_time-table_bus	we checked our bus schedule
screv_find_bus_bus	and decided where we wanted to get off .
screv_bus_stops_bus	when the sign at the front of the bus showed that it was our stop ,
screv_get_off_bus	we gathered our things and prepared to get off .
screv_get_off_bus	after we got off , we made a note of which bus stop we were at

screv_find_place_bus	and found a seat near the middle of the bus .
screv_ride_bus	as the bus drove down the road ,
relnscrev_bus	the names of each stop appeared in writing near the front of the bus .
relnscrev_bus	an electronic voice also said the names out loud so that the deaf would know what stop they are approaching .
screv_board_bus_bus	sometimes the bus driver would stop and let more people on board ,
screv_get_off_bus	and sometimes people got off .
screv_wait_bus	sometimes there was nobody waiting at a stop and nobody trying to get off , so the driver kept on moving .
relnscrev_bus	when i saw the name of the stop outside the library appear ,
screv_press_stop_button_bus	i pulled a big yellow cord hanging above the window .
screv_press_stop_button_bus	this made a noise and notified the bus driver that i wanted to get off at this stop .

screv_bus_stops_bus	after about an hour , the bus stopped at my bus stop

relnscrev_bus	and grateful and he nodded his head at me .
unrelev_bus	then i walked the rest of the way home .
unrelev_bus	i had always thought it would be hard

<end_of_story>
unrelev_bus	i live in a city where there is never enough parking .
evoking_bus	because of this , i like to take the bus .
unclear_bus	if you know what bus to take ,
relnscrev_bus	you can get almost anywhere !
relnscrev_bus	today i needed to go to the grocery store to get ingredients for dinner .
unrelev_bus	happily , there is a bus stop only a block from my apartment .

unrelev_bus	if i did n't have it ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	i would have to pay $ 23 for the ride .
screv_wait_bus	i waited at the bus stop for just a few minutes
relnscrev_bus	before a bus drove by .
screv_board_bus_bus	i did n't get on it , however , because it was the 23 bus .
relnscrev_bus	i know that i need to take the 23 or 23 to get to the grocery store .
screv_bus_stops_bus	finally an 23 bus stopped ,
screv_board_bus_bus	and i got on ,
relnscrev_bus	tapping my bus pass onto a special box near the door .
screv_ride_bus	the driver started driving down the street .
screv_bus_stops_bus	we stopped a couple of times at lexington road and then drove street .

screv_board_bus_bus	and sometimes people got on .
unrelev_bus	next it was my stop : broadway street .
relnscrev_bus	i thanked the bus driver
screv_get_off_bus	as i got off .

relnscrev_bus	every time i have to go to school or work i have to always ride a public bus .
relnscrev_bus	i have to make sure that i am by the bus stop in order to catch the bus on time .
screv_board_bus_bus	when i get on the bus ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	i have to pay the bus fare .
evoking_bus	i live in a big city , so there 's always a lot of people needing to take the bus .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	therefore ; sometimes i am not lucky to find a seat to sit on .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	in that case , i would have to stand up .
evoking_bus	overall , riding a bus is not enjoyable because it tends to be dirty , people are very loud , and it is very crowded .
unrelev_bus	not to mention , it always smells like urine .
unrelev_bus	my commute is always a long one .
screv_ride_bus	i usually stay on the bus for one hour .

relnscrev_bus	before i leave home , i always make sure that i have enough money to pay for riding the bus wherever i need to go that day and back home .
unrelev_bus	this is especially important if i am going to be buying anything else that day .

screv_bus_comes_bus	when the bus arrives ,
relnscrev_bus	i first check that it is the bus number for
relnscrev_bus	where i want to go , as different bus lines go to different areas of the city .
screv_board_bus_bus	when i get on the bus ,
screv_get_ticket_bus	i have to show my id and pay ,
screv_find_place_bus	and then i can go to a seat .
unrelev_bus	sometimes the bus can be pretty full ,
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	and i have to sit next to someone else .
evoking_bus	a lot of the same people will often ride the bus with me , so i get to know them .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i will sometimes bring a book with me to read while i ride the bus .
relnscrev_bus	i make sure to pay attention to what stop we are at , and start to prepare one stop ahead of
screv_get_off_bus	where i need to get off the bus .

screv_find_place_bus	i saw a good corner spot in the back and made my way .
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	i was hanging onto the poles because i did not want to fall over when the bus started to pick up speed .
unrelev_bus	there was an older woman who i passed and she had about two bags with her
screv_spend_time_bus_bus	and she was humming a quiet song .
unrelev_bus	there were pen markings on the chair in front of me and a piece of gum stuck to the window .

screv_board_bus_bus	the bus finally pulled up and i got on .
relnscrev_bus	i swiped my card
screv_find_place_bus	and i found a decent seat .
unrelev_bus	luckily , there were n't that many people on board and the stops were short .
screv_ride_bus	as the bus got closer to the mall ,
relnscrev_bus	and it was nearing the stop ,
screv_get_off_bus	i pulled on the line that let the driver know that she needed to let someone off .
