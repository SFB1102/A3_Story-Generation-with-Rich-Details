unrelev_library	'' i love everything about libraries ; their quiet atmosphere , comfortable chairs , and rows and rows of books on every topic .
unrelev_library	i do n't have enough money to go out and buy books whenever i want ,
screv_get_library_library	so i often go to the library to borrow books for free .
screv_get_library_library	recently , i decided to go to the library
relnscrev_library	and just browse until i found something interesting .
screv_get_library_library	i drove to the library and parked close to the door , since i expected to leave with an armful of heavy books .
screv_get_shelf_library	i walked inside and headed for the fiction section .
screv_take_book_library	i ended up in the row for authors with last names starting with k , because i wanted to find stephen king books .
unrelev_library	they ended up having a dozen books by stephen king ,
relnscrev_library	and i selected three that i had never read before .
relnscrev_library	then i went over to nonfiction to find a book on gardening , since i wanted to learn how to grow tomato plants .
screv_take_book_library	i picked up a gigantic , fantastically long book on how to grow common vegetables and walked over to the reception desk .
screv_show_card_library	i handed the librarian my card
screv_register_library	and she checked out my books .

screv_register_library	so i could check out more books .
screv_register_library	the kids card only allows you to check out two books a week , and only from the children 's room .
unrelev_library	the adult card gives me all access -lrb- at the librarian 's discretion my mom said -rrb- and six books a week !

screv_get_shelf_library	and i went to that aisle .
unrelev_library	each book had a small sticker on the spine indicating the call number .

unrelev_library	the librarian was really nice
relnscrev_library	as she took my card and typed into her computer .
screv_register_library	i checked the book out for two weeks .
screv_register_library	this would give me plenty of time to enjoy it and best of all , the librarian let me know i could check it out for even longer if i needed to .
relnscrev_library	i would just have to bring the book back on the due date
screv_register_library	and have it scanned out again .

relnscrev_library	and he told me that it was possible for me to obtain a guest pass , though this would only allow me to take out two books at a time .

relnscrev_library	the lines of shelving where they keep the books .
screv_get_shelf_library	i walked along the shelving ,
relnscrev_library	looking at the labels on the side of the shelves that said what call numbers were in the aisles i was passing .

unrelev_library	i waited too long to start working on my report that was due for my class .
evoking_library	i was in a hurry , and had to get some research material for the assignment .
unrelev_library	sadly , one of the requirements for this report was to have a couple citations from a book instead of other articles that can easily be found on the internet .
relnscrev_library	after an hour of searching for my library card , i found it at last and head out .
screv_ask_librarian_library	after i arrived i had to ask the librarian

relnscrev_library	i loved to go look through all the fiction books .
relnscrev_library	the science fiction and fantasy novels always caught my eye .
unrelev_library	i am just in love with the creative imagination involved with writing out such beautiful worlds and bringing me into them to see what they see .
screv_take_book_library	so after i had chosen my book ,
screv_go_check_out_library	i would go up to the desk .
screv_register_library	when i was checking them out ,
relnscrev_library	you had to bring your library card
screv_show_card_library	so they could scan it .

screv_register_library	scan each book ,
screv_get_receipt_library	and give you a card with a stamped due date on it .
screv_return_book_library	you could bring it back before that time , or , if the book was n't insanely popular and had no one waiting on it ,

screv_register_library	and then scan the barcode on my book .

screv_other_library_library	when i entered the library , i saw hundreds of books on many different shelves and was not sure
relnscrev_library	where to find books on tigers .

unrelev_library	are you looking for stories about tigers , or facts and photographs about tigers ?
unrelev_library	she asked me .
unrelev_library	i told her i wanted facts and real information so i can write a report .
relnscrev_library	she walked over to a group of shelves labeled nonfiction and told me that these books all had true facts and pictures , rather than being imaginary stories .
relnscrev_library	they are put in a special order using number codes called the dewey decimal system .
unrelev_library	using these codes , all the books on tigers would be in the same place and would be very close to books about other animals .
relnscrev_library	she looked up the dewey decimal system code for tigers
screv_note_shelf_library	and wrote it down for me .
screv_look_for_book_library	walking through the shelves with my code , i saw that the numbers on the spines of the books start at zero and keep getting bigger and bigger .
relnscrev_library	finally , i was getting close to the number she wrote down for me .
unrelev_library	there i saw books about lions , cheetahs , and finally tigers .
screv_other_library_library	i found a book that looked like it would be helpful for my report
screv_other_library_library	and brought it back to the librarian .
relnscrev_library	she asked me for my library card ,
screv_show_card_library	and after i handed it to her ,
screv_other_library_library	she scanned it with her computer .
screv_register_library	next , she scanned a barcode on the back of the book .
screv_register_library	now the book was checked out in my name so that the library would know who has the book .
relnscrev_library	she handed me the book and told me that i needed to bring it back to the library in two weeks .
screv_return_book_library	if i did n't bring it back ,
relnscrev_library	i would have to pay a fine for every day i kept it ,
relnscrev_library	because other people might want to read the book too .
screv_leave_library	i thanked her and went home to work on my report .
<end_of_story>
screv_ask_librarian_library	i visited the library and asked the main librarian
relnscrev_library	where i could find the fiction books .
relnscrev_library	i followed her instructions
screv_look_for_book_library	and then looked around the shelves for the mystery genre books .
screv_look_for_book_library	i browsed through the shelves of mystery books for a few minutes
screv_take_book_library	and picked out a few books that looked interesting .
unrelev_library	then , i sat down in a comfy chair near the shelves
relnscrev_library	and read the beginnings to the books i had chosen to see if i would really like them .
unrelev_library	i narrowed it down to one book that i found interesting
relnscrev_library	and enjoyable to read .
relnscrev_library	i placed the other books on a shelf to be returned to their proper place by the librarian .
screv_take_book_library	i took the book and went to the front of the library and pulled out my library card .
screv_show_card_library	i handed my library card
screv_register_library	and the book to the librarian and she scanned them both using her card scanner .
relnscrev_library	she informed me of the due date of the book and i thanked her for her help .
screv_leave_library	i left the library to go home .

evoking_library	after breakfast , i went to the library with my partner .
screv_return_book_library	i dropped my book off in the return bin
screv_other_library_library	after we walked in .
unrelev_library	she wanted to look at the section in the far back of the library , concerning the history of wood furniture .
unrelev_library	i had something special in mind .
relnscrev_library	science fiction is the genre i typically read , so i went in that direction .
screv_look_for_book_library	i browsed the long aisles for my favorite author , and saw that they had two copies of the book i was wanting to check out .
unrelev_library	i left quickly to the drinking fountain , and came back to find that there was only one copy left .
screv_take_book_library	i picked up the book and went to go find my partner ,
screv_other_library_library	who had also found her book .
screv_register_library	the checkout line was fast , we had our library cards ready for the attendant and had no issue checking out the books .
relnscrev_library	the drive home was relaxing , and we began reading right away after returning to the living room .
<end_of_story>
evoking_library	today i decided to go to the library and borrow a book to read .
unrelev_library	the library is my local public library ,
relnscrev_library	and it is very big so there are many options to choose from .
screv_get_library_library	when i arrived , i began walking up and down the aisles ,
relnscrev_library	reading the titles on the books and looking at ones that had titles that caught my eye .
relnscrev_library	i made my way through the fiction section , as this is what i prefer to read .
relnscrev_library	i perused many genres , including fantasy , horror , thriller , and mystery .
relnscrev_library	i finally settled on a book by stephen king - arguably one of the best horror writers of all-time .
relnscrev_library	it was a book i had read before , but i enjoyed it enough to read again .
relnscrev_library	after making my selection ,
screv_register_library	i made my way to the self-scanner to check out my book .
screv_other_library_library	i scanned my library card
relnscrev_library	so that the book would be logged under my account ,
screv_register_library	then i scanned the book itself .
unrelev_library	finally , i was done !
screv_leave_library	i left the library and went home to sit down and read .
<end_of_story>
evoking_library	borrowing a book from the library is so nice and super simple to do .
unrelev_library	i love doing this
relnscrev_library	because if you want to read a book and not buy it , then just go borrow it from the library .
relnscrev_library	almost every library will add new books to their collection if you ask .
unrelev_library	you just need a library card
relnscrev_library	and you can get one from any library since they are free if you have a picture id card of yourself and an address where you reside .
screv_ask_librarian_library	if you know what type of book you want , you can go to the section of the library that has that category or you can ask a librarian to help you .
screv_ask_librarian_library	if you ask politely where a certain book is , they are more than happy to help you find the book .
relnscrev_library	so once you find the book you are looking for ,
screv_take_book_library	you take it to the checkout desk
screv_show_card_library	and present them with your library card ,
relnscrev_library	then they punch the card into their computer system
screv_register_library	and scan the barcode on the book so they have a record of who has what book .
relnscrev_library	they then tell you when the book is due , and for the next designated time frame , you can spend your time enjoying the book you are borrowing from the library .
evoking_library	i go to the library just about every day
relnscrev_library	and find a good book to read and i sit outside and read it .
relnscrev_library	i went and got the divergent book and started reading it today in the library .
screv_ask_librarian_library	i had to ask the librarian
relnscrev_library	where to find it in the library since it was not where i thought it would be ,
relnscrev_library	she kindly helped me find it and asked what types of books that i enjoy reading and suggested some for me to check out after i finish this one
screv_leave_library	and then i went on my way to dive into this book and enjoy the story since i saw the movie last week .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_library	for my english class , i had to read a book about president obama .
unrelev_library	normally , i am able to find a pdf copy of a book online but i could n't find this book .
unrelev_library	i had no choice
relnscrev_library	but to go to the library to take out this book .
unrelev_library	while i was at the library ,
screv_wait_library	i had to wait on line to speak to the librarian .
relnscrev_library	i wanted the librarian to help me find the book since the library was a huge library .
relnscrev_library	i would n't be able to find the book on my own .
screv_ask_librarian_library	when i was finally able to speak to the librarian about the book , she was very warm and helpful .
relnscrev_library	not only did she tell me where the book was at but she personally walked with me to the area .
relnscrev_library	on the way , she made small talk and asked why am i reading the book ?
unrelev_library	i told her it was for an english class .
unrelev_library	a minute later , we came to the area where the book was located .
screv_take_book_library	she picked up the book and handed it to me .
screv_register_library	soon , she helped me check out the book .
unrelev_library	finally , i had the book
screv_leave_library	and i left the library .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_library	the library is a magical place where dreams are made real and fantasies are explored .
relnscrev_library	as i walk through the aisles and aisles of books i ca n't imagine what to choose .
unrelev_library	there are so many that my mind ca n't keep up .
relnscrev_library	i love to read and i do it daily .
relnscrev_library	it is my favorite hobby and i spend a majority of my time either at home reading or at the library finding new books to read .
unrelev_library	the best part about the library is not having to buy the books or spend money .
screv_show_card_library	you simple give them your card and they let you take the book home for a long enough period to read and bring back .
relnscrev_library	if the book is too long to read then you can simply check it out again
screv_return_book_library	and bring it back when you are finished .
unrelev_library	as long i keep a good standing with the library i can keep doing this all my life !
<end_of_story>

relnscrev_library	the machine starts printing out the date of when the books are due .
screv_other_library_library	the librarian hands me back the books , library card , and due date .
relnscrev_library	i take the books home to do further research for my history assignment that 's due next week .
<end_of_story>

relnscrev_library	a lot of people lke to borrow books from the library for all kinds of reasons but we just wanted some books to read for fun .
screv_get_library_library	we already knew which books we wanted before we got to the library so when we got there ,
relnscrev_library	we just had to find them .
relnscrev_library	it is possible to look them up and find them on the libary 's computer .
unrelev_library	if you are in a hurry ,
screv_ask_librarian_library	you can ask the librarian to help you find them a little easier and more quickly .
relnscrev_library	when we found out where to find the ones we wanted ,
screv_register_library	we found them and took them to the librarian to check them out to us .
screv_register_library	she put the book information in the computer
screv_other_library_library	and then she swiped our library cards .
unrelev_library	it did n't take very long at all .
screv_register_library	when shed put them into the system
screv_other_library_library	and swiped the cards , she printed out a slip of paper that showed exactly what day we needed to turn them back in , in order to avoid any late fees .
relnscrev_library	when we were ready to take them back ,
screv_return_book_library	we turned them in to the librarian
screv_look_for_book_library	and then looked for more !
<end_of_story>
evoking_library	i go to the library very often and am always borrowing books .
relnscrev_library	when i decide to go , i take any books with me that i have read and need to return .
screv_get_library_library	once i get to the library ,
relnscrev_library	i will walk in and put any books in the return slot that i have brought back .
unrelev_library	i will then go to the section where they put all the new releases of books
screv_browse_releases_library	and see if there are any that i am meaning to read .
screv_browse_releases_library	i also check out my two favorite sections of the library
screv_take_book_library	and grab a couple of the books that i have been meaning to read or that are the next in a series .
evoking_library	when i 'm ready to borrow the books ,
screv_go_check_out_library	i head up to the main desk
screv_wait_library	and wait in line .
unrelev_library	when it is my turn ,
screv_register_library	i place the books on the counter for the person to scan .
screv_show_card_library	i also have to give them my library card so that they can keep track of who is borrowing the books .
screv_other_library_library	they scan my card , and then print out a receipt that shows when my books will each be due .
unrelev_library	they put the receipt inside one of the books so that i wo n't lose it ,
relnscrev_library	and after i thank them for their help , i head home to begin reading my new books .
<end_of_story>
evoking_library	i love going to the library to check out books .
unrelev_library	it is probably one of my favorite places to go to , since i 'm a fairly avid reader .
screv_get_library_library	anyway , i 'll usually bike to the library and bring a backpack with me
relnscrev_library	so that i can easily bring my books home .
unrelev_library	the last time i went , i was looking for some books on local folklore for a class that i 'm taking .
unrelev_library	i quickly went to one of the computer search stations
screv_use_computer_library	and typed in the last name of an author that i knew had written a book on the subject .
unrelev_library	i got back a couple more results than i had expected ,
screv_note_shelf_library	so i made note of them .
screv_use_computer_library	then , i searched by just the topic of folklore , along with the tribe that i was covering .
relnscrev_library	i found several books that looked like they might be interesting .
screv_note_shelf_library	so , i took the numbers for where they would be and headed off towards the stacks .
unrelev_library	i followed the numbers to the different rows
screv_take_book_library	and picked up the books that i needed , as well as a couple other books that also sounded interesting .
screv_go_check_out_library	my arms full , i took them all to the checkout counter ,
screv_other_library_library	where a nice older man scanned them and gave me a printed receipt that said when i would need to have them back by .
unrelev_library	all in all , it was a pretty productive trip to the library .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_library	the other day i decided that i wanted to read a book , but all the ones i had in my home i had read already .
evoking_library	when i was thinking about what to do , i spotted my library card and decided that i 'd go borrow a book .
screv_other_library_library	i drove over and headed inside .
relnscrev_library	i 've always liked libraries , they 're usually nice and quiet and you never know what kind of interesting books you might find when you 're looking around .
screv_browse_releases_library	i started by looking at the new arrival shelves , but nothing there really caught my eye .
unrelev_library	i headed over to one of the library computers
screv_use_computer_library	and brought up the book search .
unrelev_library	it took me a little while to decide what kind of book i wanted , but eventually decided i wanted a science fiction book , just something to enjoy for a little while .
screv_use_computer_library	i started browsing through all the search results until a book caught my eye .
screv_note_shelf_library	i noted down the shelf number it should be in and went over to it .
screv_take_book_library	i found my book and took it to the desk ,
screv_show_card_library	where i gave the librarian my library card and the book .
screv_register_library	he checked it out for me
screv_other_library_library	and handed them back .
screv_leave_library	after that , i headed home and sat down to read my book .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_library	a library is a great way to re-live the past .
unrelev_library	it 's a magical place
evoking_library	where you can rent a book ,
relnscrev_library	and return it at a leisurely pace .
unrelev_library	now-a-days there are many digital options so the library has become all but extinct .
relnscrev_library	on the plus side they may have some very rare finds that you can review .
evoking_library	in order to borrow a book from the library ,

evoking_library	last week i went to the library to get a book .
relnscrev_library	one of my friends had recommended that i read a book called the chocolate wars .
screv_get_library_library	i went to the library saturday afternoon .
unrelev_library	i walked into the main area on the first floor and went to a computer terminal ,
screv_use_computer_library	where i looked up the book by its title .
relnscrev_library	the library catalog gave me a call number that identified where the book was stored .
screv_note_shelf_library	i wrote the call number down on a little slip of paper , then i took the slip of paper
screv_other_library_library	and went to the shelves where the books are .
unrelev_library	at the end of each row of book shelves , there are signs that told me which books were in that row .
screv_other_library_library	i found the row where the number i was looking for was , then i looked at the numbers on the books on those shelves
screv_other_library_library	until i found the number that matched the chocolate wars .
screv_take_book_library	i pulled the book off the shelf and liked the cover , so i decided i would go ahead and read it as my friend suggested .
screv_go_check_out_library	i took the book to the circulation desk
screv_other_library_library	and gave it to the librarian with my library card .
screv_other_library_library	the librarian swiped my library card through an electronic reader
relnscrev_library	and told me the book would be due in two weeks .

relnscrev_library	reading is very important to me ,
relnscrev_library	and with the amount that i read , it is economical to use a library to borrow the books i would like to read .
evoking_library	when borrowing a book , i get my son into the car
screv_get_library_library	and we drive to the library .
screv_take_book_library	usually we find a few books for him to borrow as well ,
screv_get_shelf_library	so we go to the children 's section first
screv_take_book_library	and pick out two or three books for him .
screv_look_for_book_library	that way , when we go to find a book for me , he has something to entertain him .
screv_get_shelf_library	then we go to the fiction section for adults .
relnscrev_library	usually my son ryan will sit on the floor looking at his books next to me
screv_register_library	while i find book to check out .
screv_look_for_book_library	i find a book or two
screv_go_check_out_library	and then ryan and i go to the check out
screv_register_library	and use my library card to check out the books .
screv_other_library_library	the librarian usually puts them in a bag
screv_leave_library	and then we leave the library to go home and enjoy our books .

unrelev_library	a while back i realized i needed some instructional material for a project i was working on , and searching for information on the internet was n't yielding the results i desired .
evoking_library	i thought about other sources of information and realized that the library would probably have a book pertaining to what i needed .
unrelev_library	so i got in my car
screv_get_library_library	and set off for the library .
screv_get_library_library	once i got there ,
screv_obtain_card_library	i signed up for a library card since i knew i 'd need that to be able to borrow a book .
unrelev_library	i then went to one of the reference computers
screv_look_for_book_library	and searched for the book i was looking for .
screv_look_for_book_library	i found the dewey decimal code for the book i wanted ,
screv_get_shelf_library	and set off through the aisles .
screv_get_shelf_library	finally , i found the aisle i was looking for .
screv_look_for_book_library	it only took me a moment from there to find the book i wanted .
screv_go_check_out_library	book in hand , i went back to the library counter .
screv_register_library	i told the librarian i 'd like to borrow the book .
screv_register_library	she wrote my information down and on the insert in the book ,
screv_get_receipt_library	and gave me a due date .
screv_leave_library	then i was on my way .
screv_take_book_library	that 's how i borrowed a book from the library .

screv_get_library_library	as i got to the library ,
relnscrev_library	the librarian greeted me with a big smile and made small talk .
screv_look_for_book_library	i then looked up the book i wanted on the computer .
relnscrev_library	it was available ,
screv_get_shelf_library	and i made my way down the long rows of bookshelves .
screv_look_for_book_library	i found my book easily , and i also found a couple others i 'd like .
screv_take_book_library	i carried my stack of books to the counter , and the same librarian was happy to help me .

screv_other_library_library	and she also recommended some further reading .
screv_register_library	she checked out my books in the computer .
screv_return_book_library	two of the books needed to be returned in two weeks and the other needed to be returned in one week .

relnscrev_library	in my english class i was recently assigned to read the book brave new world .
unrelev_library	my first idea was to just buy it but when i went to the local bookstore it cost $ 23 .

screv_other_library_library	calling in ahead to make sure that they did indeed have the book that i wanted ,
screv_get_library_library	i then headed in the direction of the library .
screv_get_library_library	when i arrive they had already had the book up front
screv_other_library_library	as i requested so that all i had to do was go pick it up .
unrelev_library	or so i thought .
screv_obtain_card_library	in actuality i had to spend time getting a new library card .
relnscrev_library	the librarian walked me through the process while also giving me a little background on the book i was about to read .
screv_show_card_library	after i had gotten my new library card i simply gave it to the librarian
screv_register_library	and she checked out the book for me .

unrelev_library	there were so many shelves of gardening books !
screv_take_book_library	i found a few that i liked and decided i needed a basket .
screv_other_library_library	i got one from the circulation desk .

screv_other_library_library	one day my daughter and i were looking for movies .
relnscrev_library	she told me about needing to download a book because she had seen a movie recently and wanted to read the book now .
screv_look_for_book_library	she was kind of shocked when i suggested that we look for the book at the library .
screv_use_computer_library	she thought that people just used the computers there
screv_other_library_library	and borrowed movies .
screv_look_for_book_library	she did not think that they would have the book that she wanted .
relnscrev_library	she thought that the only books there were encyclopedias and old books .
screv_take_book_library	she was really surprised when we were able to find the book that she had been wanting to download .
relnscrev_library	now , she would rather read a regular paper book than read a book on her tablet .
unrelev_library	this kind of made me happy .
