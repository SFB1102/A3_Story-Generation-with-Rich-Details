relnscrev_train	as i stood in line ,
screv_check_time-table_train	i looked at the board showing all the departure times to new york .
screv_train_departs_train	lucky for me , there was a train leaving in half an hour .
screv_get_tickets_train	i made my way to the front of the line and asked to buy a ticket for that train .

unrelev_train	before i knew it ,
screv_arrive_destination_train	we were pulling into the station in new york .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_train	instead of driving up to visit my husband 's sister 's family in sf , we decided to take the train !
screv_get_tickets_train	i bought the tickets online
relnscrev_train	and printed them out a few days before we left .
relnscrev_train	i packed some bags and some snacks for our trip and made some plans to go to breakfast prior to departure .
unrelev_train	we were late getting out the door , of course .
screv_get_train_station_train	we parked our car and got to the station within a few minutes -lrb- luckily ! -rrb- .
unrelev_train	we carried our suitcases onto the car ,
relnscrev_train	stored our luggage appropriately ,
screv_find_place_train	and took our assigned seats .
screv_conductor_checks_train	i gave my husband his ticket in the circumstance he wandered off and was stopped by an attendant .
screv_spend_time_train_train	we began to talk about what we wanted to do on our visit , as the train began to roll away from the station .
screv_spend_time_train_train	he decided to find us coffee and breakfast , and i decided to take a quick nap while he was gone , knowing that it was just an excuse to explore for a bit .
<end_of_story>
relnscrev_train	i traveled by train to a visit a friend who lived a few hours from me .
unrelev_train	i planned to stay overnight ,
relnscrev_train	so i packed a suitcase to take with me .
screv_get_train_station_train	when i arrived at the train station ,
screv_get_tickets_train	i went to the ticket counter to purchase a ticket .
screv_train_departs_train	i looked at the schedule of departing trains and selected the time i wanted to leave .
screv_get_tickets_train	i paid for my ticket
screv_wait_train	and waited .
screv_train_departs_train	after a while , it was time for my train to depart .
relnscrev_train	i went to the front of the train with other passengers .
unrelev_train	i carried my small suitcase with me .
screv_conductor_checks_train	the conductor took my ticket , stamped it ,
relnscrev_train	and handed it back .
screv_find_place_train	i found a nice seat by the window
relnscrev_train	and settled in for the ride .
unrelev_train	when everyone was aboard ,
screv_train_departs_train	the train announcer announced that we 'd be leaving the station .
screv_train_departs_train	he announced where we were leaving from , and the final destination .
screv_spend_time_train_train	i brought a book with me to read , and some snacks in case i got hungry .
relnscrev_train	as the train traveled ,
relnscrev_train	i watched the scenery that went by - there were small houses and fields with cows .

unrelev_train	my friend picked me up at the station and we drove away in her car .
<end_of_story>
screv_spend_time_train_train	i like to ride on trains because you can see lots of countryside without having to worry about driving .
unrelev_train	one time , when i lived in alaska ,
evoking_train	i rode on a train from fairbanks to denali park .
screv_get_tickets_train	just like with all train rides , i had to buy a ticket first
screv_train_arrives_train	and then i had to stand in line to wait for the train to stop at the station .
screv_get_on_train	then i climbed onto the train
screv_find_place_train	and picked a seat .
screv_spend_time_train_train	the different places you can sit in a train are called cars .
screv_spend_time_train_train	you do n't have assigned seats like on a plane and the seats are wide for more than one person to sit .
screv_find_place_train	so , i picked one in a car in the back
screv_spend_time_train_train	and sat right beside the window .
screv_train_departs_train	after the train started moving ,
screv_conductor_checks_train	a train attendant walked through to check our tickets and then i stood up to walk around .
screv_spend_time_train_train	you can walk from car to car on a train and can even go out of the back of the very last car
screv_spend_time_train_train	and stand outside , so i did that .
screv_spend_time_train_train	it was very fun to be standing outside
relnscrev_train	while the train was moving and i hung onto the railing to be sure i was safe .
screv_spend_time_train_train	then i went back inside and went to the dining car
relnscrev_train	where i bought a sandwich and water .
unrelev_train	after i got back to my seat ,
screv_spend_time_train_train	i ate and watched the scenery through the window .
screv_spend_time_train_train	i saw lots of interesting things including a moose
screv_arrive_destination_train	and we arrived at denali right after that .

screv_get_train_station_train	i chose a day and arrived at the train station 23 hour before my train was scheduled to leave .
unrelev_train	there was a ticket counter in the station .
relnscrev_train	i walked up the counter
screv_get_tickets_train	and bought my ticket from a lady behind the counter .
screv_get_tickets_train	after i got my ticket ,
screv_get_on_train	i needed to wait for the train to board passengers .
screv_wait_train	i sat on a big wooden bench inside the train station .
screv_get_on_train	when it was time to get on the train ,
relnscrev_train	the doors opened and a ticketperson took each of our tickets
screv_get_on_train	as we got on the train .
screv_find_place_train	we got to choose our seats .
screv_find_place_train	i choose a window seat
relnscrev_train	and put my bags in the compartment nearby .
relnscrev_train	partway through the ride , a train employee came by with snacks and drinks .
screv_spend_time_train_train	i looked out the window and read a book .
screv_arrive_destination_train	when we arrived in seattle ,
relnscrev_train	i grabbed my bags from the baggage compartment ,
screv_get_off_train	exited the train , and hugged my waiting grandma !

screv_find_place_train	i found my seat towards the back of the train .
unrelev_train	i was happy to have a window seat
screv_spend_time_train_train	so i could view the scenery during the trip .
relnscrev_train	i set my luggage aside and settled into my seat .
relnscrev_train	the steward came over and asked if i wanted a beverage .
relnscrev_train	i said i would like a water .
relnscrev_train	she quickly returned with my drink .
screv_train_departs_train	shortly after , the train departed .
unrelev_train	i was impressed with the scenery during the trip .

relnscrev_train	i had arrived in boston .
<end_of_story>
evoking_train	to go on a train ride to chicago , i had to have a ticket .
screv_get_tickets_train	it is possible to buy tickets online , but it was fun to go to the train station to get them .
relnscrev_train	at the train station , i got in line and waited my turn .
unrelev_train	when i got to the window ,
relnscrev_train	i told the station agent where i wanted to go , when , and what kind of ticket i wanted .
relnscrev_train	she told me how much i had to pay .
relnscrev_train	you can pay with cash , but i paid by credit card .
unrelev_train	it is a long trip ,
relnscrev_train	so i had to show my identification as well .
relnscrev_train	since i was going in an hour ,
screv_wait_train	i waited for the train .
screv_wait_train	you can wait in the station , but i waited on the platform .
unrelev_train	the ticket will tell which platform you want .
screv_get_on_train	the train arrived at the platform in plenty of time for everyone to get on board .
screv_get_on_train	as i got on ,
relnscrev_train	i showed my ticket to the conductor , but kept it .
screv_find_place_train	then i found myself a nice seat .
screv_find_place_train	usually , young able-bodied people will take the upstairs seats , and leave the downstairs seats for people who want to sit down right away .
screv_find_place_train	soon after i took my seat , i heard someone outside call , all aboard !
unrelev_train	there was a gentle chugging sound
screv_train_departs_train	as the train slowly got underway .
screv_conductor_checks_train	the conductor soon came and took my ticket ,
relnscrev_train	and fastened up a card with my destination by my seat .
screv_spend_time_train_train	now i was free to roam about the train , looking out the windows and watching the countryside fly by .
relnscrev_train	each stop was announced over the p.a. system well in advance , so i knew just when to get off the train .
relnscrev_train	when i heard chicago announced ,
screv_get_off_train	i went downstairs to wait with the other people who were getting off there .
unrelev_train	we were all standing up , so we hung on tight .
relnscrev_train	when the train doors opened ,
screv_get_off_train	we stepped down carefully onto the platform in chicago .
<end_of_story>
evoking_train	i wanted to take a trip on a train .
relnscrev_train	i thought it would be fun to travel through the countryside .
relnscrev_train	i called the train directory
screv_get_tickets_train	and booked a ticket for a country journey day trip .
screv_get_train_station_train	i arrived at the train station , full of excitement .
relnscrev_train	i handed my ticket to the conductor .
screv_find_place_train	i found my seat which was near a window ,
screv_spend_time_train_train	so i would be able to take in all the sights
relnscrev_train	as the train traveled along .
unrelev_train	after the train car was filled ,
screv_train_departs_train	the conductor told us that we would be departing on our journey
screv_arrive_destination_train	and when we would arrive at our destination .
screv_train_departs_train	the train lurched forward with a mighty gust and began to chug along .
unrelev_train	i could hear the wheels clacking across the tracks
screv_spend_time_train_train	as i enjoyed the lovely scenery that was passing by .
screv_arrive_destination_train	when we arrived at the destination ,

evoking_train	i recently was able to enjoy the privilege of riding a train .
relnscrev_train	my friend and i had quite a distance to travel .
evoking_train	after some discuss with several option we decided to take a train to our destination .
relnscrev_train	we found out where the train station was located and found the window to buy a ticket to our destination .
unrelev_train	we had our choice of coaches
relnscrev_train	but we chose the cheapest one which meant hard seats that do not recline , no air or food offered in our car section .
relnscrev_train	i had no idea that it would take 23 hours to travel to our destination .
unrelev_train	it really felt like a lifetime ,
screv_spend_time_train_train	especially when you can not get comfortable and find a position to relax .
screv_spend_time_train_train	we tried several ways of resting but after a few minutes we would get up and reposition ourselves .
unrelev_train	the ride was nice overall though
relnscrev_train	because the conductor would stop every four hours or so to allow for bathroom breaks and food purchases at the stops .
screv_spend_time_train_train	we took the night train so the majority of the time we would not able to enjoy the view out of the window but when daylight broke and we were able to see outside it made the trip go by quicker .
unrelev_train	so , overall i have to say that it was a very good experience and cheap too .

relnscrev_train	i was traveling on vacation a few months ago , and decided to take a train to my destination instead of flying .
evoking_train	i have always wanted to travel by train , and this was a good opportunity .
screv_check_time-table_train	i went online to look at the train schedules .
unrelev_train	there were quite a lot of them , so it took me a while to narrow down my choices based on

screv_get_on_train	when we boarded the train ,
relnscrev_train	we gave the ticket to a ticket taker , and he escorted me to my booth .
unrelev_train	it was fun and exciting .
unrelev_train	finally after all the passengers were on board ,
screv_train_departs_train	we were off .
unrelev_train	the train seemed a bit jerky in the motion , but eventually it smoothed out .
unrelev_train	it was so much fun ,
screv_spend_time_train_train	seeing all of the towns
relnscrev_train	and cities we passed through .
relnscrev_train	some we stopped at and some we just passed through .

unrelev_train	recently i was invited to a function at a church with a downtown location .
relnscrev_train	i live in a large city that has trains that travel within the city and also go to nearby towns .
relnscrev_train	there are several routes that the trains travel called lines and they are named by colors : red , green and orange .
relnscrev_train	this is so passengers know what train to take to get where they want to go .
evoking_train	the last time i went to that church i had a lot of trouble finding a parking spot , so i decided to take the train there .
relnscrev_train	i knew that the train station was only a few blocks away from the church so it would be easy to get to the church .
screv_get_train_station_train	i drove to the train station closest to my house , and parked the car in the parking lot .
screv_get_train_station_train	i walked to the station , where there were many benches for passengers to sit while they waited for their trains .
unrelev_train	there was a machine on the platform that let you choose what type of ticket you needed .
relnscrev_train	you could buy a ticket for only going one way or a round trip .
screv_get_tickets_train	i chose the round trip ticket since i wanted to take the train to the church and back again .
screv_get_tickets_train	the machine had a display that told me how much money i needed to deposit in the little slot .
screv_get_tickets_train	i put the money in the machine and my ticket popped out .
screv_train_arrives_train	i waited for my train to arrive .
unrelev_train	when it did ,
screv_door_opens_train	the doors opened and lots of people got off the train .
screv_get_on_train	i got on and everyone who was waiting for the train got on , too .
relnscrev_train	i looked for a seat .
screv_find_place_train	i picked a seat that was facing forward , but there were seats that faced the center of the train and even ones that faced backward .
relnscrev_train	the train 's doors shut and the train started to move along the rail .
relnscrev_train	it went very fast .
unrelev_train	the train had windows on both sides
screv_spend_time_train_train	and i looked out at the sights
relnscrev_train	as we sped along .
relnscrev_train	in a few minutes it stopped at another station ,
screv_get_on_train	and some people got off and others got on .
screv_conductor_checks_train	pretty soon the conductor walked up
screv_conductor_checks_train	and down the aisle asking to see everyone 's ticket .
screv_conductor_checks_train	i showed her my ticket and she nodded and smiled .
relnscrev_train	at the next station , the train stopped .
unrelev_train	this was the station that was closest to the church ,
screv_get_off_train	so i got off .
relnscrev_train	when it was time to go home ,
relnscrev_train	i waited at the station for the train that would take me home again .
evoking_train	taking the train is a lot of fun , and sometimes a lot easier than driving .

screv_find_place_train	my sister and i took turns sitting by the window .
relnscrev_train	sometimes all we saw was cornfields and cattle .
relnscrev_train	occasionally , we would pass a small town and see people at different stops .
screv_spend_time_train_train	we didn ' t order food on the train
relnscrev_train	because we brought our own .
relnscrev_train	we actually had brought cakes , pies and sandwiches to carry us over .
screv_spend_time_train_train	we shared our food with the people around us .
screv_spend_time_train_train	the whole car sang christmas carols

unrelev_train	there 's a bank of windows at the far side of the building .
relnscrev_train	i went over to one of them
screv_get_tickets_train	and asked for a one way ticket to new york city .
screv_get_tickets_train	i paid for the ticket with my credit card and then went to sit on the hard wooden booths in the middle of the station .
screv_check_time-table_train	i looked up at the huge arrival screen at the front of the station .
screv_check_time-table_train	my train was listed there with a number of others .
relnscrev_train	it said the train was on time
screv_train_arrives_train	and would arrive at the station soon .
screv_train_arrives_train	when it came in ,
screv_get_on_train	there was an announcement that the train to new york was boarding .
screv_get_platform_train	i got up and walked with about thirty other travelers down some stairs and along a long hallway , then up another flight of stairs and out onto a platform .
relnscrev_train	the train was there next to the platform with its doors open .
screv_get_on_train	i walked into the train
screv_find_place_train	and took a seat by the window
relnscrev_train	so i could watch things go by as we traveled .
screv_train_departs_train	soon the train started moving along the tracks .
relnscrev_train	after a while the train 's conductor walked down the aisles saying , tickets please . tickets . over and over .
screv_conductor_checks_train	i handed him my ticket and he punched a hole in it
relnscrev_train	and put a ticket stub in the back of the seat in front of me .

screv_spend_time_train_train	so i settled in with a book .
relnscrev_train	i enjoyed watching the countryside pass when i got bored with the book .
screv_spend_time_train_train	when i went to the bathroom i could n't get the door to bolt shut all the way .
relnscrev_train	the train braked and the door slid open and i had to stand to re-shut it .
unrelev_train	a passenger next to the restroom saw my butt .

screv_get_train_station_train	we arrive at the train station at 5:30 am , snacks and blankets in tow in our bags .
screv_get_tickets_train	we purchased our tickets the other day , so we did n't have to worry about going to a booth to buy any .

screv_conductor_checks_train	and we handed him ours .
screv_get_on_train	we hopped onto the train
screv_find_place_train	and took our seats towards the back of the train
screv_spend_time_train_train	so that we could discuss a lot of what we were going to say and do in the meetings for our trip without being distracted much .
screv_spend_time_train_train	as we discussed our plans and strategies , we 'd occasionally look out the window and see lush trees and valleys , animals , plains ,
relnscrev_train	and all manner of environments as we traveled from state to state .
screv_other_train_train	we had to switch trains a few times at different stations , but the process was pretty smooth and it is always nice to hear that whistle and the all aboard !
screv_arrive_destination_train	when we arrived at our destination ,
screv_get_off_train	we got off of the train ,

relnscrev_train	the first thing i did when i got to the train station was see what train goes to their neighborhood .
screv_check_time-table_train	after i figured that out , i made sure i had enough money on my metro card to pay the train fare .
screv_train_arrives_train	after going through the turnstile i waited on the train platform for the train to enter the station .

screv_find_place_train	then , i picked a spot that was open and sat down quietly .

relnscrev_train	knowing which direction the train heads towards is the most important thing as you do n't want to waste time going the wrong way .
screv_check_time-table_train	once this is determined ,
screv_get_platform_train	i will head towards the train platform
screv_train_arrives_train	and wait until the train arrives .

screv_get_platform_train	we took our suitcases and went to the platform ,
screv_wait_train	where other people were waiting .
screv_train_arrives_train	eventually -lrb- a little late -rrb- , the train pulled in .

relnscrev_train	my dad called amtrak -lrb- train company -rrb-
screv_get_tickets_train	and ordered 23 tickets for the next weekend .
evoking_train	when the weekend came we got onto the train .
unrelev_train	this train was different , it was a double-decker or a train with two floors .
screv_find_place_train	we got to our seats and to the side was huge windows that went from the back of the train car to the front .
unrelev_train	i could n't believe how incredible all the trees and birds looked .
screv_spend_time_train_train	then we got to the observation car .
unrelev_train	i did n't even think this type of car existed .
unrelev_train	the train car was all class except for the floor and the lower parts of the wall , above was all glass .
screv_spend_time_train_train	then we rode in the observation and watched as the rain fell down .
unrelev_train	it was an unbelievable event and i would highly recommend it .
<end_of_story>
evoking_train	the other day , i had to catch a train from los angles to new york at the last minute .
unrelev_train	my boss wanted me to meet some foreign client in a brand new art gallery they recently bought in manhattan .
relnscrev_train	the boss called me at about 5:30 in the morning and told me that he already bought tickets to get from here to new york , but explained to me that he could n't make it as he had another meeting to that same morning .
screv_train_departs_train	the tickets were for a train that departed at 7:15 am , so like a good worker bee , i got up , skipped showering , got dressed , and ran out the door with a dirty wrinkled suit i had n't had time to wash .
unrelev_train	the airport was 23 minutes away so i had very little time to spare .
screv_get_platform_train	i managed to store my car and walk into the train station half asleep right at 7:10 am
relnscrev_train	when i overheard my train was delayed over the intercom .
relnscrev_train	when my train was called an hour later ,
screv_find_place_train	i drowsily made my way on board where i got a window seat next to a larger fellow .
unrelev_train	i remember i was half asleep when i mumbled a hello to him .
unrelev_train	he happily greeted me back
screv_find_place_train	as i sat down .
screv_train_departs_train	right before the train took off and the trains stewardesses were telling us how to use our seat belts , i barely remember ending up falling asleep on the large man next to me .
evoking_train	four hours later , i got a nudge from the large man next to me telling me kindly to wake up and that our ride was over .
screv_spend_time_train_train	i distinctly remember waking up with a mouthful of drool soaked on the large man ' s arm i feel asleep on and instantly apologized .
unrelev_train	he laughed and said to me don ' t worry about it !
unrelev_train	you looked so tired !
unrelev_train	would you believe this is n't the first time this has happened to me ?
unrelev_train	we both kind of laughed and went on our ways .
evoking_train	it ended up being a great ride and sleep , overall .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_train	every time i have to go to the city ,
evoking_train	i have to take the train .
evoking_train	one day , when i was on the train ,
screv_train_arrives_train	i had to wait twenty minutes for the next train to arrive .
screv_train_arrives_train	when it arrived , ,
relnscrev_train	the place was full .
relnscrev_train	it was full because it was rush hour .
unrelev_train	that 's the time when everyone is coming out of work or school .
screv_find_place_train	i could n't find a seat at all !
screv_find_place_train	i had to stand up throughout my whole ride .
unrelev_train	it was very uncomfortable
screv_find_place_train	because i had to stand up for an hour ride .
relnscrev_train	to make matters worse , more people wanted to squeeze inside the train .
unrelev_train	now everybody was on top of one another .
screv_other_train_train	soon , the train could n't move anymore because there were just too many people on the train .
screv_other_train_train	the door would n't close therefore ;
screv_other_train_train	the conductor could n't drive the train .
screv_get_off_train	eventually , people started to come out and i was able to breathe .
screv_train_arrives_train	finally , i reached my stop and was relieved to be out of that train .
<end_of_story>
screv_get_train_station_train	my family and i arrived at the station early in the morning because we had to make sure we were on time .
unrelev_train	normally we are late to almost everything we do , so if we shoot for being early that normally means being on time .
screv_get_on_train	the train pulls up and we show our tickets and climb aboard .
evoking_train	we choose to ride the train because the plane tickets were simply way to expensive .
screv_spend_time_train_train	on the train we get drinks and some snacks to pass the time .
screv_spend_time_train_train	we also play cards and talk the entire ride so that in no time we have arrived at our destination .
evoking_train	the train had no problems and it seemed like the fastest ride i had ever been on .
relnscrev_train	if we would have taken a plane it may have even taken longer than this ride had taken because of all the unfortunate things you have to go through at an airport .
relnscrev_train	the train ride was an enjoyable experience and i look forward to heading back home on the next train .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_train	when i went on vacation last year with my parents ,
evoking_train	we took a trip on a train for part of it .
relnscrev_train	we picked the route we wanted to take to go visit my uncle ,
relnscrev_train	and had everything ready the day before , such as our suitcases .
relnscrev_train	when the day arrived for us to go ,
screv_get_train_station_train	my dad drove us to the train station
relnscrev_train	where we parked in a designated lot ,
relnscrev_train	since we would be returning to the same train station .
screv_get_train_station_train	we then headed to the train station and went inside
screv_get_tickets_train	where my dad purchased our tickets .
unrelev_train	we had some extra time ,
screv_wait_train	so we wandered around and found a little gift shop where we could buy souvenirs .
screv_get_on_train	when it was time to board our train ,
screv_get_platform_train	we walked through the station to get to the correct area .
screv_get_platform_train	there were long hallways to get there , and then we went up a concrete pathway to
relnscrev_train	where the train was outside .
screv_get_on_train	we had to give the ticket taker our tickets so she could verify we were getting on the right train .
screv_get_on_train	we all gathered in the train
relnscrev_train	and found some seats that had n't been taken .
screv_other_train_train	we stored our luggage and prepared for the train to begin its journey .
screv_train_departs_train	once it was time to leave ,
screv_spend_time_train_train	we watched out the windows at all the passing scenery .
screv_spend_time_train_train	after awhile , we all started doing our own thing like reading or playing cards to pass the time .
unrelev_train	it was a lot of fun
evoking_train	and really neat to take a train trip .
<end_of_story>
evoking_train	the last train trip i took was with a couple of friends to go and check out an art museum that was fairly far away .
relnscrev_train	we met up at the station with plenty of time to spare ,
relnscrev_train	so we chatted for a bit
screv_wait_train	while we waited .
screv_get_tickets_train	we had already purchased our tickets ahead of time , just to make things easier .
screv_train_arrives_train	when the train arrived ,
screv_find_place_train	we boarded and found our seats .
relnscrev_train	we did n't bring much , just small bags ,
screv_other_train_train	so we did n't have to stow anything .
screv_conductor_checks_train	the conductor came by and checked our tickets
screv_train_departs_train	as the train left the station .
evoking_train	it was a nice ride .
screv_spend_time_train_train	the train seats are always fairly comfortable and we had time to play racing games on our dss
relnscrev_train	while we rode .
screv_spend_time_train_train	i also got to watch some rather lovely scenery ,
relnscrev_train	once we got out of the city .
relnscrev_train	going by trees
screv_spend_time_train_train	and landscapes and watching them pass is pretty fun too .
relnscrev_train	plus , there were n't that many other people in the train car that we were in , so it was a nice
evoking_train	and peaceful ride .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_train	last month i wanted to go visit my parents in florida , but i hate to fly .
evoking_train	after thinking about it for a little while , i decided to take the train .
unrelev_train	it 's not as fast as flying but it is a lot faster than driving .
relnscrev_train	i got on my computer
screv_check_time-table_train	and pulled up the train schedules to see if there was one that would work to get me where i was going .
screv_train_arrives_train	after checking a few , i found one headed the way i needed to go that was also running at the right time .
screv_get_tickets_train	i bought a round trip ticket right from the website .
screv_train_arrives_train	since it would only take 23 hours to get there , i did n't bother getting a spot in a sleeper car , just a regular seat .
screv_other_train_train	i packed up the things i needed and headed to the train station .
screv_get_on_train	once i was there i checked in and got on the train .
screv_train_departs_train	about 23 minutes later it was time to go and the train rumbled out of the station .
screv_find_place_train	i had a window seat ,
relnscrev_train	so i could watch the scenery go by as we sped along the tracks .
relnscrev_train	after a little while i decided to go up to the food car
screv_spend_time_train_train	and get some lunch .
screv_spend_time_train_train	i sat in the food car , ate and played a game on my tablet .
relnscrev_train	after a while i went back to my seat ,
screv_spend_time_train_train	plugged my headphones into my tablet and just watched the country roll by while i listened to my music .
screv_arrive_destination_train	we got to florida on time and i had a great visit with my parents , and best of all , i did n't have to fly !
<end_of_story>
evoking_train	my family and i wanted to take a trip via train across the country .
unrelev_train	i called a travel agent to set up a time to meet with them and discuss the necessary arrangements .
unrelev_train	a few days later the appointment arrived and i went to the travel agent 's office to meet with them .
evoking_train	after discussing our travel plans we decided that getting a private room on a sleeper car for the family would be the best option .
screv_get_tickets_train	i purchased the tickets and then went home to tell the family we were going and to pack .
screv_get_train_station_train	a week later we arrived at the train station an hour
screv_get_on_train	before boarding time to make sure that we did not miss the train .
screv_find_place_train	once it was time we boarded the train and found our room .
screv_other_train_train	we stowed our luggage and discovered how the beds worked .
relnscrev_train	later it was time to eat and we went to the dining car at our scheduled time far dinner .
unrelev_train	after which we went back to our room
screv_spend_time_train_train	where we did some talking before finally falling asleep .
relnscrev_train	when we woke up we were only an hour from our destination .
relnscrev_train	we had enough time to get changed and pack our things up and before we knew it we were getting off the train .
unrelev_train	it was a very pleasurable experience .
<end_of_story>
evoking_train	riding on a train is a great way to commute , especially when frequenting a city !
unrelev_train	it 's a great reminder of transportation of the past , and a great way to spend an afternoon .
relnscrev_train	a specific example would be when i frequent the great city of boston .
evoking_train	i always choose to take the train in , as driving into the big city can be a great hassle .
screv_check_time-table_train	in this day and age it 's convenient to look up train times ahead of time on the appropriate website .
relnscrev_train	once you determine the train that you will take you will need to find transportation to the train stop , either by walking , bus , or getting dropped off .
screv_get_tickets_train	once at the train station go up to the ticket window or use a handy kiosk to purchase your ticket .
screv_conductor_checks_train	take this ticket and head through the checkpoint , or if you are using a commuter rail bring it with you to give to the train attendant .
relnscrev_train	as you start moving and stopping they will announce each stop .
screv_wait_train	wait until your stop has approached and exit the train .
unrelev_train	congratulations , you just saw the countryside !
<end_of_story>
evoking_train	the night before i take a train ride ,
screv_check_time-table_train	i look at the train schedule .
relnscrev_train	usually i am going to new york city ,
screv_train_arrives_train	so i check the train schedules for the trains heading there .
evoking_train	when my husband and i take the train , we go early , so that morning i wake up early and get ready for the day .
screv_get_train_station_train	we then drive to the train station and park our car .
screv_get_train_station_train	depending on which train station we are going to , the parking is free , but otherwise we pay for our parking .
unrelev_train	once parked ,
screv_get_platform_train	we walk to the platform
screv_get_tickets_train	and buy our tickets at the automated teller .
screv_train_arrives_train	then we wait for the train to arrive .
screv_train_arrives_train	when the train arrives ,
screv_spend_time_train_train	we find a good place to sit .
screv_spend_time_train_train	we try to sit where there are n't too many people
relnscrev_train	and where there are only 23 seats
screv_spend_time_train_train	so that we do n't have to sit with strangers .
screv_train_departs_train	then the train takes off and we usually are on the train for an hour
screv_train_arrives_train	before we get to our destination .
<end_of_story>
evoking_train	yes going on a train , this is was our ideal weekend activity not too long ago .
relnscrev_train	we purchased tickets to travel from boston to new york city .
screv_get_platform_train	as we entered the platform of the train is was pure steel and looked so solidly strong .
screv_find_place_train	we walked down the isle and found an comfortable looking seat and decided to sit there .
relnscrev_train	shortly the train horn blasted making me jump of my seat lol .
screv_train_departs_train	anyway we soon started moving and our train ride was underway .
screv_conductor_checks_train	the conductor walked the isles and collected our tickets .
screv_spend_time_train_train	love scenery so i had the window seat watching everything along the way .
unrelev_train	first i saw large suburban areas
screv_train_arrives_train	but as we got into connecticut many farms were being spotted .
unrelev_train	it was n't very hilly but sure was a country atmosphere .
screv_arrive_destination_train	soon we approached nyc
screv_train_arrives_train	and the train came to slow stop ,
screv_arrive_destination_train	we had arrived at our destination .
relnscrev_train	the ride overall was rather smooth and it did n't seem to take all that long .
<end_of_story>
unrelev_train	i decided that i wanted to visit a town that was about an hour away from me .
evoking_train	rather than drive , i decided that it would be a good day to take a ride on the train .
relnscrev_train	i made sure that i had all my things together
screv_get_train_station_train	and drove to the train station .
unrelev_train	i parked in the designated parking lot across the street ,
screv_get_train_station_train	and went into the small station .
screv_wait_train	i waited at the counter for a few minutes
relnscrev_train	before an attendant strolled out from the office .
unrelev_train	she smiled and asked me
relnscrev_train	where i would like to go .
screv_get_tickets_train	i told her that i 'd like a round trip ticket for today to the nearby town .
screv_get_tickets_train	she got on her computer to confirm my route and times , and i decided to purchase the tickets .
screv_get_tickets_train	i gave the attendant my money ,
relnscrev_train	and she put it in her drawer
screv_get_tickets_train	while my tickets printed off her printer .
screv_wait_train	i thanked her , and set out the door to wait for my train .
relnscrev_train	shortly after i sat down , i could hear the sound of the train in the distance .
relnscrev_train	once it was stopped and unloaded , the conductor shouted all aboard !
screv_conductor_checks_train	and i gave him my ticket .
screv_train_departs_train	i boarded the train and set off .
evoking_train	and that 's how i rode the train .
<end_of_story>
screv_get_train_station_train	after eating breakfast this morning i noticed that it was time for me to get off to work so i decided to walk down to the train station
relnscrev_train	so i could be off to work .
evoking_train	i always take the same train to work every day and i usually see a lot the same faces
evoking_train	when i ride the train .
screv_get_tickets_train	i bought a ticket at the front
screv_train_arrives_train	and waited for the train to arrive .
screv_find_place_train	once the train arrived i boarded the train and took a seat .
relnscrev_train	i had to go 23 stops
screv_arrive_destination_train	before i would arrive to work
screv_spend_time_train_train	so i took out my phone and decided to send out some emails .
relnscrev_train	after the first few stops the train started to get quite crowded so i decided to stand and give my seat up to an elderly gentleman .
unrelev_train	he was thankful for the seat and i was happy to do him the favor .
screv_train_arrives_train	the train then arrived at my stop
screv_get_off_train	and i got off to make my way to work .

screv_get_train_station_train	as we arrived at the station , we saw the train coming in .
screv_get_off_train	many people got off the train

relnscrev_train	we were able to find seats even though the train was pretty full .
screv_train_departs_train	as the train left the station we started working on our computers , and the 23 minute ride seemed to just fly by .
unrelev_train	the view of the city from the train was beautiful .
screv_train_arrives_train	when we arrived at the station in the city , the people on the train started to queue up at the doorways .
screv_train_arrives_train	the train came to a smooth stop
screv_get_off_train	and all the people poured out onto the platform where it was lightly raining .
<end_of_story>

screv_wait_train	whenever my train arrives i have to get in line
screv_conductor_checks_train	as they process our tickets .

evoking_train	taking a train somewhere can be an old-fashioned way of travel , but it can also be a lot of fun !
unrelev_train	train tracks do n't go everywhere anymore and they certainly are n't used as often .
