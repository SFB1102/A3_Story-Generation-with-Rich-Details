screv_ride_bike_bicycle	i went on a bike ride in the afternoon yesterday , the weather had an amazing break of sunlight , and i had to take advantage of it .
unrelev_bicycle	gearing up for the bike ride was n't very time consuming , it only took about 23 minutes to change , grab my helmet , and fill a water bottle from the sink .
unrelev_bicycle	i left home ,
screv_ride_bike_bicycle	and progressed close to 23 miles
relnscrev_bicycle	before i heard a low hiss escape from somewhere below where my feet were .
screv_notice_problem_bicycle	i almost knew immediately that it was going to be a flat tire .
screv_get_off_bicycle	i had my friend pick me up , they helped get me home without further incident .
screv_lay_bike_down_bicycle	after getting my bike up on it 's stand , i began to peel the bad tire off the rim ,
relnscrev_bicycle	finding the tube had a small puncture .
screv_put_new_tire_bicycle	i decided to to replace the tube entirely , and fitted the tube and tire back onto the rim , fixing the issue of the flat tire .

screv_ride_bike_bicycle	last week when i went biking on a trail with a friend , she rode over a nail and one of her bike tires was punctured .
screv_ride_bike_bicycle	we immediately stopped riding so that we could fix the problem , and we were lucky that it was n't too bad of an issue .
evoking_bicycle	to fix it ,
relnscrev_bicycle	we had to return home and take care of it with the tools we had there .
screv_lay_bike_down_bicycle	we turned the bike over
relnscrev_bicycle	so it was resting on the handlebars and the seat so that we would have access to the wheel very easily .
screv_other_bicycle_bicycle	upon spinning the wheel ,
screv_other_bicycle_bicycle	we found the nail she had run over and removed it .
screv_other_bicycle_bicycle	we had to release all the air from the tube to begin with ,
relnscrev_bicycle	then take the tire off of the rim using tools called a tire levers .
unrelev_bicycle	after we had that off ,
screv_take_tire_off_bicycle	we had to remove the tube from the tire
relnscrev_bicycle	and inflate it with enough air to find the hole .
unrelev_bicycle	we knew about where it would be .
relnscrev_bicycle	using a piece of my brother 's chalk ,
screv_other_bicycle_bicycle	we marked where the hole was so we would n't lose the spot ,
screv_other_bicycle_bicycle	and then we took the air out of the tube again .
relnscrev_bicycle	using a patch kit designed for this kind of issue ,
screv_other_bicycle_bicycle	we patched up the hole and put the tube back into the tire .
screv_put_new_tire_bicycle	we put the tire back on the wheel
screv_refill_tire_air_bicycle	and re-inflated it .
screv_ride_bike_bicycle	the patch worked perfectly and we were able to go out biking again the next day !
