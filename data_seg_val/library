evoking_library	yesterday i used my new library card to borrow a book .
screv_get_library_library	it was so easy ! i drove down to the library early in the morning ,
relnscrev_library	just as soon as the library opened .
screv_get_library_library	when i entered the library , i said hi to the lady behind the counter ,
screv_look_for_book_library	and went over to the science fiction section to look for a book that might catch my fancy .
screv_other_library_library	i soon found a very good looking book about a boy who meets an alien in his backyard .
relnscrev_library	i really wanted to read the book , but i knew it would take me a few days , so i decided to borrow it for awhile .
screv_go_check_out_library	i brought the book up to the lady at the counter , and she asked me for my library card .
screv_show_card_library	i showed it to her ,
screv_other_library_library	and she entered some information in the computer .

screv_get_library_library	i decided to go to the library this morning
relnscrev_library	as i had run out of books to read .
relnscrev_library	i still love using the public library because they give me the option to borrow the book .
relnscrev_library	when i arrived at the library i was greeted at the door kindly , which i always like about the public library .
unrelev_library	they feel more like a friend of yours than anything else .
relnscrev_library	i wanted to the fiction section as i like to read stories that are make believe .
screv_take_book_library	i found a few books that i was interested in reading and decided to sit down and read a few chapters of them to see if i would like to check them out .
relnscrev_library	i grabbed myself a cup of coffee from the desk first and then proceeded to sit down and read the book .
relnscrev_library	after reading the books for about an hour i decided to borrow all 23 of them .
screv_go_check_out_library	i went to the librarian
screv_register_library	and checked them out .
screv_leave_library	i then left satisfied with my experience .
